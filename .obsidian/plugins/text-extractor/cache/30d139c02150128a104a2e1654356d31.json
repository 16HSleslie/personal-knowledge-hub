HUBS 191 Human Movement and Sensation Theme 2: Integrating and coordinating roles of the nervous system Lecture 16: Cells and organisation of the nervous system Dr. Rob Munn, Director of Neuroscience Department of Anatomy “Integrating and coordinating...” What does that mean to our nervous system? 2 1. Senses environment - Thirsty - Cold - Hear loud/scary noise 2. Produces an appropriate response - Drink water - Get warmer - Prepare to run (flight) or confront it (fight) Matches sensory environment with our body’s needs HUBS 191 Human movement and sensation Endocrine system Immune system Gastrointestinal system Renal and urinary system Reproductive System Respiratory system Musculo- skeletal tissues and movement The integrating and co-ordinating roles of the nervous system Cardiovascular system and blood Integumentary system (skin) Biostatistics HUBS 192 Homeostatic principles and homeostasis in action 3 HOMEOSTASIS Integrating and coordinating - Maintaining homeostasis. 4 Sensory experience Response Integration (often happens with your knowing it) • see food • smell food • Am I hungry? • Do I want that kind of food? • Do I want that much food? Coordination • Preparation for eating • Cravings for some other type of food • Thoughts of doing something else • Order some! • Go to a different restaurant • Walk away 5 https://www.innerbody.com/image/musfov.html New Line Cinema New Line Cinema 6 @benjammins New Line Cinema Content of Rob’s Neuroanatomy lectures 7 Lecture 16 – Cells & organization of the nervous system Lecture 17 – Functional Information Flow Lecture 20 – Anatomy and Function of the Spinal Cord and Spinal Nerves Lecture 21 – Meninges and ventricular system Lecture 22 – Layout of the brain AND Sensory and Motor pathways Overall Learning Goal: To understand what the nervous system is, the cells and structures that make it up, how they are organised and connected into circuits that receive information from the world around us, and control what we think, feel, and do. = Interest and context: Not directly examined! = KEY CONCEPTS: Very important! Structure of Neuroanatomy Lectures • Intro material – get your head around concepts from a broad perspective • Specific details you need to know • Examples to illustrate concepts • Multiple examples = repetition for good remembering • Post-lecture quizzes (Answers in next lecture) – Gives you idea of what kind of material and question style may be on exams. 8 After reviewing and studying this lecture, you should understand and be able to describe: 1. The basic organisation of the nervous system and the cell types therein 2. The general structure of a neuron, and understand how this structure a. is functionally related to directional flow of information b. varies to give 4 distinct morphologies 3. The five main types of glial cells and their functions, and be able to contrast these with neuronal structure and function 4. The structure of a synapse 5. The concept that an electrical nerve impulse changes to a chemical signal at the synapse 6. The directions of information flow within (into and out of) the nervous system Lecture 16 - Learning objectives 9 Basic anatomical organisation of the nervous system Brain Spinal cord Peripheral nerves & ganglia Composed of 2 general cell classes • Neurons • Neurons • Glia• Glia• Neurons • Glia Consists of Consists of Composed of 2 general cell classes Modified from: Martini 3rd ed, Fig 11-1, p445 Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) [including ENS] Central Nervous System (CNS) 10 Cells of the nervous system: (ii) Come in two main types I. Neurons (nerve cells) 2 general features → II. Glia (Greek: glue) 3 general features → 11 1. Support for neurons 2. Five basic types a) 4 in CNS, 1 in PNS 3. Each type has a specific function 1. Cells specialised for transmission of information 2. Four morphological types 11 Cells of the nervous system: (I) Neurons – Structural Components Cell body [2 features] • Contains nucleus & organelles • Sums input Axon [2 features] • Carries electrical impulses • May or may not be myelinated Axon terminal(s) [2 features] • End (terminus) of the axon • Neurotransmitter release Dendrites [2 features] • Receive input • Send info to cell bodyAction potential Martini 3rd ed, p446 12 a) Nucleus (pl. = Nuclei) b) Tract c) Grey matter d) White matter a) Ganglion (pl = ganglia) b) Nerve Organisation of the nervous system: Cell bodies and axons are segregated 13 • Group of cell bodies • Bundle of axons • Group of cell bodies in cerebral cortex or spinal cord • Bundle of axons in cerebral cortex or spinal cord In the CNS… • Group of cell bodies • Bundle of axons In the PNS… 14 UBC Neuroanatomy Grey matter – this is where you will find the soma or cell bodies of neurons White matter – this is where you will find the axons. These are long fiber tractsOUTPUT CONDUCTION SUMMATION INPUT Input zone: ➢Dendrites and cell body ➢Receives chemical signals from other neurons Cells of the nervous system: (I) Neurons – Functional components (zones) Summation zone ➢ Structure = Axon hillock ➢ Summation of inputs Conduction zone ➢ Axon, may be quite long ➢ Carry electrical signals between brain areas, to and from spinal cord, or from peripheral sensory receptors and to effector cells Ouput zone ➢Axon terminals ➢Contact with input zone of other neurons or effectors ➢Release of neurotransmitter = chemical signalinformation flow → Dendrites Cell body Axon Axon terminals Martini 3rd ed, p446Action potential → 15 Martini 3rd ed, p446 Axon Hillock Axon hillock: Anatomical location where inputs are summated before action potentialAction potential → 16 Cells of the nervous system (i) Specialised for specific tasks ... so they look different. http://www.pnas.org/content/95/9/5323/tab- figures-data https://www.pinterest.nz/pin/436567757 604237316/ http://www.bioquicknews.com/node/4757 17 Atheletes’ bodies are specialised for specific tasks… ... so they look different. https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1094113/valerie-adams-shot-put-tokyo-2020 https://theconversation.com/can-eliud-kipchoge-run-a-sub-2hr- marathon-it-all-comes-down-to-15-extraordinary-seconds-124981 18 Cells of the nervous system: (I) Neurons – 4 Morphological types • Multiple processes emanate from the cell body • Two(2) processes emanate from the cell body • One process emanates from the cell body, • Then branches into dendrite and axon Images from: Martini 3rd ed, p448 1.
