**Dendritic cells (DCs)** are critical for linking innate and adaptive immunity.
**Activated dendritic cells** communicate with T cells via:
- Cytokine secretion
- Cell surface receptor-ligand interaction
- Antigen presentation

Explanation:
- DCs recognise pathogens via PAMPs, become activated, and migrate to lymph nodes.
- In lymph nodes, DCs present antigen to T cells using MHC molecules, secrete cytokines, and engage in direct receptor-ligand interactions.
- This communication activates T cells, bridging innate detection and adaptive response.
