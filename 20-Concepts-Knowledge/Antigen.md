**Antigen** is anything that can be recognised by the immune system.
- **Foreign antigen**: Originates from outside the body (e.g. pathogens, transplant, chemicals)
- **Self (auto) antigen**: Normally tolerated by the immune system; recognition can lead to autoimmune diseases

### Explanation
- The immune system distinguishes between self and non-self antigens
- Loss of tolerance to self-antigens can cause autoimmune disorders (e.g. Rheumatoid arthrits, Type 1 Diabetes)
