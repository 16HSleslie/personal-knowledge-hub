Objectives to know that: • Immune deficiencies can be inborn or induced by viruses (also by some medical treatments* or poor nutrition). • The concept of tolerance to self-antigens. That Rheumatoid arthritis and type I diabetes are examples of immune cells attacking self cells (autoimmunity). • The effector molecules (IgE) and cells (T cells, B cells and mast cells) involved in the allergic reaction. e.g. *Chemotherapy / radiation therapy 1 Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) • X-chromosome linked disease, therefore more common in XY-males. Note XX-females are ‘carriers’. Patients lack functional T cells and B cells. 2 Virus-induced immune suppression • Measles, HIV and many other viruses interfere with normal host immune system. • HIV targets and can kill CD4 T cells. • This leads to a diminished levels of CD4 T cells unable to provide “help” for antibody and cytotoxic responses. 3 Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) • HIV-receptor is CD4 molecule on CD4 T cells • Infection leads to loss of CD4 T cells • CD4 T cells help both humoral (B cell / antibody) and cytotoxic responses, • HIV infection impacts on immunity to microbes (fungi, bacterial and virus) and to cancer. 4 CD8 TCR MHC-I peptide APC CTL apoptosis Perforin / granzyme Vaccines / pathogens Virus- infected cell B cell Antibody production TCR MHC-II CD4peptide CD4 ‘Help’ ‘Help’ CD8 Plasma cell Native antigen MHC-I / Peptide TCR HIV CD4 5 Autoimmune disease • Normally prevented by host mechanisms of immune tolerance (next slide). • Although the innate system can trigger autoimmunity or exacerbate (make worse) autoimmunity... • Autoimmune attack is mediated by the adaptive immune response. 6 Immune tolerance • Immune tolerance is critical to avoid autoimmunity. • The thymus acts to delete autoreactive (self- reactive) T cells. • In the periphery there are other mechanisms to ensure that autoreactive T and B cells are silenced. • Failures (due to your genes or triggering infection) in immune tolerance can lead to autoimmunity. 7 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints (an example of what happens when our immune cells attack self tissue) Autoreactive T cells and B cells attack self-antigens present in the joints. Affects ~1% of population. Often late onset in life. 89 Diabetes Type I: Insulin beta-cells attacked. Other islet cells may escape autoimmune attack. 10 Allergic reactions • ‘Allergens’ are the antigens that trigger allergy. • Are normally ‘harmless’ environmental antigens: non-toxic plant, animal or other food materials. • Chemicals can induce allergy (e.g. penicillin) • Range of outcomes: from hay fever to systemic anaphylaxis 11 Allergic reactions: the effector response: • DC present peptides from peanut proteins (allergens) to helper T cells • Primed helper T cells activate B cells to secrete IgE • Secreted IgE binds to mast cell receptors (FcR) • Binding of peanut proteins to FcR on mast cells triggers mast cell degranulation and release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators 12 Peanut allergies 13 14 Dendritic cell Mast cell Fc receptor (FcR) Mast cell B cell Peanut specific IgE Sensitisation Triggering cytokine ‘help’ CD4 helper T cell Peanut antigens 1. DC takes up peanut antigens and activates CD4 helper cell. 2. CD4 T cells provide help for B cells that form IgE secreting plasma cells. 3. IgE binds to Fc receptors on mast cells. 4. Peanut allergens trigger (via IgE / FcR) mast cells to release histamines and other inflammatory mediators. Inflammatory mediators TCR MHC-II + peanut peptide 15 Fc domain Fc receptors (FcR) bind to the Fc domain (on constant region) of antibody. FcR facilitate a number functions, including phagocytosis and mast cell activation (see previous slide). CH1 CH3 VH VL CL Antigen binding site CH2 CH1 CH2 CH3 VH VL CL Fc 1. Rearranged in bone marrow (during generation of diversity) 2. Constant region may switch during immune response.

An example of immune tolerance is: (A) Neutrophils dying to form becoming pus-cells (B) Virus-infected cells being destroyed by cytotoxic T cells in the skin (C) Autoreactive, immature T cells (thymocytes) being deleted in the thymus upon recognition of self- peptide in the context of MHC. (D) B cells stimulated to produced antibodies reacting the synovial membranes 27 HUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
