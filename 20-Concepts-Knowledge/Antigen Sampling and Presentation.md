**Dendritic cells** are the most potent antigen-presenting cells, present in major organs

### Explanation
- DCs phagocytose (engulf) antigens, process them into peptides, and migrate to lymph nodes
- In lymph nodes, DCs present antigens peptides to T cells via MHC molecules, initiating adaptive immune response

### Purpose of Antigen Uptake
**Innate response**: Clearance of pathogens
**Adaptive response**: Presentation to T cells for specific immune activation
