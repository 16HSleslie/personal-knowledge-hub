Reference text: 5 • The HUBS office is located in Room G01, ground floor, Microbiology building. • Enter the building, go to the right of the elevators. • Contact the HUBS office if you have any problems (e.g. with timetable) • Phone: 479 7106 • Email: hubs@otago.ac.nz • The HUBS laboratory is located in Room G08, ground floor, Microbiology building. • Enter the building, go to the left of the elevators, past the male toilet, and the lab is straight ahead. • Cubby holes are provided inside the lab for your belongings. • Please do not wear lab coats outside of the lab. Where are the HUBS office and lab?! HUBS officeHUBS lab 6 Lectures (begin Mon 24th February) • 3 Lectures per week – check eVision for where you need to go • Quad 2 is our overflow lecture theatre • Lecture slides available by noon the day before the lecture • Recommended pre-readings for all lectures are available in the lecture objectives document • Lecture recordings will be available after the lecture is finished and the file is compiled. They will remain on Blackboard for 2 weeks from the date of the lecture. • You will need to take notes! Pen/paper or digital- lectures are more than what is on the slides! • All lecture content is examinable EXCEPT anything marked ‘for interest only’ 7 • Labs are compulsory! They are a Terms requirement and essential for succeeding in HUBS – this is the place where you will “learn by doing”. • eVision will show which lab stream you are assigned. You will attend a lab once in a 2 week period. If you are unable to attend your lab you need to restream to another session. • Labs start on the hour and if you are late you will need to restream- we recommend arriving 5-10 minutes early. Labs run for 3 hours. • You will need to complete some activities (pre-lab tasks) on your own before/after the lab • You will receive your lab manual in the first lab. Laboratories (begin Mon 3rd March) 8 Laboratories • You must have a labcoat and shoes which completely enclose your feet to work in the lab. You will also need to tie up long hair. • You must bring your student ID with you to labs. ➢ You will need to scan your ID card for attendance • You cannot have phones or computing devices in the lab ➢ These need to be kept in your bags, or not brought to class 9 Learning Modules (LMs) • On the xOtago platform • Next week you will receive an email (to your student email) with details on how to log in. • For any issues contact hubs.tf@otago.ac.nz • Open at start of each major lecture block • Close after Final Exam • Online quizzes– formative only • These LMs are designed to help you learn 1. Bones and Biomechanics 2. Biostatistics 3. Nerve and Muscle 4. Endocrine System 5. Immunology Note: while available, you can review these LMs as many times as you like. 10 Assessment Note: Students must gain 40% IN THE FINAL EXAM in order to pass HUBS 191 Type Number Time allocated % Marks Final Examination 1 3 hrs 70% Progress Tests 2 30 mins per test + 15 min for practice essay 20% total (8% PT 1, 12% PT 2) Labs 6 Lab summary quizzes 10% total LMs 5 Your choice (estimate 4 hrs each to complete) Formative only Key Dates Progress Test 1: Saturday, 29th March (45 mins) Progress Test 2: Saturday, 17th May (45 mins) Final Exam: TBA June (3 hrs) 11 MCQ Structure • Progress Tests and the Final Exam use MCQs to test your knowledge • Final Exam also has ‘mini essays’ ➢ You will practice mini essays in the Progress Tests, LMs, in some lectures 12 If the left atrium of the heart is contracting, which of the following is most likely to be CORRECT? A. The left ventricle is also contracting. B. The right ventricle is also contracting. C. The right atrium is also contracting. D. No other chamber of the heart is also contracting. If you have questions... • About how HUBS works, lab or assessment absences, general enquiries etc: ➢ Contact the HUBS office G01 Microbiology Building ➢ hubs@otago.ac.nz ➢ 03 479 7106 • About issues with accessing xOtago for LMs: ➢ Contact hubs.tf@otago.ac.nz • About lecture or lab content: ➢ Ask your lecturer in person after the lecture (please do not email them) ➢ On Discussion Board (check for the tab on Blackboard) ➢ At the weekly drop in Q&A: HUBS office, day/time announced weekly ➢ To your Redcoat in labs ➢ At the in person drop ins before the tests and exam 13 What are the top mistakes that prevent people from passing HUBS? • Missing lab (and not making it up) ➢ Remember, labs are a terms requirement ➢ Contact the HUBS office as soon as possible if you miss lab ➢ We do want to help you, so don’t hesitate!!! • Falling behind on the material ➢ For an 18 point paper (like HUBS), students are expected to spend about 180 hours total (~12 hours per week) in total ➢ Because the material keeps arriving at a steady rate, it can be difficult to catch up! ➢ Communication is key! If you feel you’re falling behind, let us know as soon as possible so we can work together on a plan to get you back on track. 14 What material is examinable??? • Lecture content ➢ HUBS doesn’t have ‘core slides’ ➢ Consider anything on the slides, unless lecturers specify that it isn’t, as examinable content ➢ Lecture content is not just what is written on the slides, but what is talked about in the lecture • Laboratory content ➢ Labs generally complement lecture content ➢ Some new concepts in Labs- these are examinable ➢ Experiments carried out in Labs are examinable too 15 What about the textbook? How should I use it? • Review the recommended sections, skimming or reading in detail depending on how you feel after the lecture • Pay particularly close attention to terms or concepts that were unclear in lecture – might explain the info a different way! • Take some time to look at the figures (and their captions) that were also presented in lecture • Read the recommended sections BEFORE lecture • This makes key terms and concepts more familiar when the lecturer is covering them in class • Tell them that they need to memorize everything in the book, because the lecturers purposely pick out random details they never covered to use as exam questions! (This is NOT true!) 16 My goal is to: Pass HUBS Maximize my mark Troll my friends in HUBS 17 Strategies for Lecture Note Taking BEFORE – review the Lecture Objectives, read the recommended sections in your textbook DURING – Listening and writing – at the same time…use shorthand? ➢ Beginning of lecture – often a brief reminder of previous lecture ➢ Objectives – in lecture objectives document (a great revision tool) ➢ Capitalise or underline key words ➢ Questions to self - ??? Put a note in the margin for revisiting AFTER ➢ Draw a concept map or construct your own diagram ➢ Reading of textbook material to review any points that were unclear ➢ Look up meanings for any words you didn’t understand ➢ Rephrase lecture objectives and questions and try to write a summary answer Studying Anatomy in New Zealand today Bodies come from bequests Informed consent: people while alive made the free choice to donate their bodies. 18 Prosections which are plastinated Studying AnatomyHuman Tissue Act 2008 1. Voluntary donation of bodies 2. Requires dual signed consent by the donor and an immediate family member 3. Most bodies are held for ~18 months, however body parts can be kept for longer periods for teaching and research (allowed under the Act) Show respect for the bodies & body parts. Treat material as having a special importance. 1920 If you have any questions regarding the body bequest programme or the use of human tissues in this course, please contact Dr Rebecca Bird from the Dept of Anatomy (rebecca.bird@otago.ac.nz). Working with human material in your practical class Your practical laboratory classes may involve the handling of human material donated to the Department of Anatomy through our body bequest programme. Our practical teaching spaces have been blessed by a Kaumātua, Māori Advisor for the University, making the space a safe environment for you to work in. Wai ora (cleansing water) is available outside the classroom for you to use as you leave your class. If you need additional support, please don’t hesitate to contact the Māori Centre, the Kōhatu Centre for Hauora Māori or the department’s Kaiāwhina - Dr Rebecca Bird & Dr Charlotte King 21 Lecture Objective After you have revised this lecture you should be able to: • Describe the four basic types of tissue – what is similar and what is different.

The least common? (Don’t need to know exact percents!) • Would you find in your knee joint? (Hint: it’s more than one!) 29 Summary: • HUBS191 explores the Anatomy, Physiology and Immunology of the human body, along with Biostatistics • Time management is key for doing well in HUBS191 • Use resources! • The body bequest programme involves individuals who have given their informed consent for us to use their bodies after they die. The Human Tissue act (2008) governs how we must behave with these tissues • Four basic tissues make up the body: Epithelium, Connective, Muscle and Nervous 30 HUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
