Objectives • Know that adaptive immunity evolved in vertebrates. • Understand how antigen is sampled by immune cells and how it is presented on MHC • Know the expression patterns of MHC-I & MHC- II on cells Pre-reading: Marieb; Adaptive Defences: p800-804 2 White blood cells (leukocytes) are a minor constituent of blood. But they are the main cells involved in immunity. Plasma Leukocytes Red Blood Cells 34 Infection and inflammation of tissue e.g. skin Lymph node *Dendritic cells T cell and B cell activation *Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen presenting cell Antibodies Cytotoxic T cells Lymphatic vessel Antigen sampling and presentation • Dendritic cells (DC) are present in major organs. • They phagocytose (gobble up) antigen and process it down to peptides. • DC migrate from organs (e.g. skin) to draining lymph node. • They present peptides on MHC to other white blood cells (called T cells). Pre-reading: Marieb; Antigen presenting cells: p804-805 56 CD8+ TCR MHC-I peptide APC CTL apoptosis Perforin / granzyme Vaccines / pathogens Virus- infected cell B cell Antibody production TCR MHC-II CD4peptide CD4+‘Help’ ‘Help’ CD8 Plasma cell Native antigen MHC-I / Peptide TCR Adaptive immunity • Dendritic cells (DC) present peptides on MHC to T cells • CD4 T cells help B cells make antibody (L36) • CD8 T cells become cytotoxic and kill virus infected cells and cancer cells (L35) Pre-reading: Marieb; Antigen presenting cells: p804-805 78 What is ‘antigen’? • Anything that has the potential to be recognised by the immune system. • Foreign antigen (transplants, pathogens, some chemicals). Anything from ‘outside’. • Auto (self)-antigen: Immune system normally tolerant of self-antigen. Self-antigen may be recognised in autoimmune disorders (e.g. Rheumatoid Arthritis or Diabetes Type I). 9 Purpose of antigen uptake • Clearance of pathogens (innate response) • For presentation to T cells (adaptive response; L35) 1011 500 million years ago… Phagocytes evolved to keep remnants of pathogens and display these to other cells of the immune system. This was the beginning of the adaptive immune response. 12 Jawless fishes (Agnathans) ‘Adaptive’ immunity Darwin Chris King (1997, 2009) http://dhushara.com 13 Vertebrates possess both innate and adaptive immune systems All I need is a blood sample for my experiments… 14 Evolution of Immunity • Invertebrates (e.g. insects, spiders, jellyfish) have innate immunity only. • Vertebrates have both innate and adaptive systems. • Note: Jawless fish (Agnathans: hagfish & lamprey) are vertebrates with both innate and adaptive systems. But their adaptive system is based on different structures cf. other vertebrates. 15 Peptides loaded onto MHC molecules for immune surveillance Destruction Phagolysosome 16 MHC expression • MHC-I presents endogenous (intracellular) antigen. Expressed on all nucleated cells. • MHC-II presents exogenous (extracellular) antigen. Expressed only on antigen presenting cells. 17 Peptides loaded onto MHC class I molecules for immune surveillance Cytoplasmic antigen e.g. virus Endogenous antigens Destruction CD8 T cell proteasome Viral Proteins MHC-I Viral protein translation peptides Virus infection The ‘proteasome’ degrades cytoplasmic proteins to peptides. peptide 1819 MHC-I antigen processing • Antigens are degraded in the cytoplasm by the proteasome to peptides. • Peptides are imported into endoplasmic reticulum (ER). • Peptide loading of MHC-I takes place in ER. 20 Peptides loaded onto MHC class II molecules for immune surveillance Destruction Phagolysosome Phagocytosis of exogenous antigen Exogenous antigens 21 MHC-II antigen processing • Antigenic proteins are degraded in acidic phagolysosome. • Peptide loading of MHC-II takes place in phagolysosome. Summary • Subsets of white blood cells mediate the immune response • Antigen (self or foreign) is anything that an immune system recognises • Peptides are fragments of protein antigen that are displayed by MHC-I and MHC-II on cells • Endogenous (e.g. viral) antigens displayed on MHC-I • Exogenous (e.g. extracellular bacteria / viruses) antigens displayed on MHC-II 222324 The best definition of antigen is: A) A substance that causes allergies B) Anything that can be recognised by an immune system. C) A substance that causes inflammation. D) A molecule released by frightened ants 25 MHC-I molecules present antigens from which source? A) Exogenous (antigens originate from outside cells) B) Microbes that cause sepsis C) Macrophages D) Endogenous (antigens expressed in cytoplasm) 26 The following is true of exogenous antigen processing A) It only occurs when antigen is directly expressed in the cytoplasm B) Antigen from extracellular bacteria / viruses is presented by this pathway C) It does NOT involve phagocytosis. D) Exogenous antigen is destined for MHC-I presentation 27 The adaptive immune system: A) Evolved prior to innate immunity B) Operates independently of the innate immune system C) Is present in humans and apes, but absent in fish and reptiles D) Evolved 500 million years ago 28 MHC-I is present on ____, while MHC-I and MHC-II are both present on _____.
