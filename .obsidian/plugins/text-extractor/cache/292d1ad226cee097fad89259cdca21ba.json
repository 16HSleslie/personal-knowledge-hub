Escher Relativity-2 CHEM202 Rigid Transition States Anti Addition to C=C Androstan-3-ol • The OH is equatorial so H-3 is axial • Build a splitting tree by considering each coupling in turn – J3,2 - axial/axial (~10 Hz) – J3,4 - axial/axial (~10 Hz) – J3,2 - axial/equatorial (~5 Hz) – J3,4 - axial/equatorial (~5 Hz) • Predictions: – a 7 line pattern – a bandwidth ~30 Hz 1010 105 5 55 5 5 5 5 5 Exercise – 1 2 3 4 H HO H HH HH the 3a-epimer exhibits a 5 line pattern with band width ~20 Hz. Verify this using J values of 5 Hz for eq/eq and eq/ax couplings From Last Lecture Exercise – HOH the 3a-epimer (of androstan-3b-ol) exhibits a 5 line pattern with band width ~20 Hz. Verify this using J values of 5 Hz for eq/eq and eq/ax couplings Stereochemical Controls Important roles in organic synthesis: • routes to specific stereoisomers • ability to perform selective manipulations of sets of identical functional groups We look at 3 types of reaction: • those with rigid transition states (Lectures 5 & 6) • those controlled by ease of access (Lecture 7) • those promoted by steric acceleration (Lecture 8) Anti Addition - I Introduces 2 new groups, one to each face of a double bond - e.g. addition of Br2 (CHEM 191) Note the formation of a three-membered ring which forms then is re-opened – cf example of neighbouring group participation involving S in Lecture 3) Anti Addition - I I Br + + + 3 scenarios for the intermediate: 1. Usually has bonding between Br and the two C (bromonium ion) – the incoming Br:– is forced to attack from other side (anti) 2. Sometimes unsymmetrical – the weaker bond is to the C that can best accommodate + – Br:– usually attacks the more +ve C – however, attack may be the other way round if this C is sterically hindered – addition is still anti Anti Addition - III 3. If the +ve centre is highly stabilised, the intermediate may be a true carbocation – this may be attacked from either side (cf SN1) – i.e. no longer anti Br Br etc Br Br Epoxidation / Epoxide Opening Epoxidation/opening sequence has same overall stereochemical consequences: Step 1 - epoxidation: Step 2 - nucleophilic opening: C C O HO O R peracid O H RCOO O RCOOH epoxide O Nu O Nu H + OH Nu Stereochemical Analysis Anti additions proceed through two stages: 1. Formation of a 3-membered ring intermediate 2. Opening of the intermediate by a nucleophile Three Questions: A. In 1, is there preferential attack from one face of the C=C? B. If both sides of the C=C are attacked, do the 2 routes give different stereoisomers? C. In 2, the 3-membered ring has 2 sites for attack. Is one preferred? A. In 1, is there preferential attack from one face of the C=C? • Usually there is no distinction - products resulting from attack at either side are formed in equal amounts • But, some molecules show facial selectivity. Steroidal alkenes give mainly -face attack B. If both sides of the C=C are attacked, do the 2 routes give different stereoisomers? • There will be no stereoisomers if the intermediate has a plane of symmetry C. In 2, the 3-membered ring has 2 sites for attack. Is one preferred? • Openings may be SN2 like: – The preferred site is the least sterically crowded – i.e. 1o > 2o > 3o • If there is some degree of SN1 character: – The preferred site is the one which best accommodates a +ve charge – i.e. 3o > 2o > 1o Bromination of (E)-2-butene A. No distinction between the 2 faces of the alkene - consider attack from both sides B. The 3-membered ring intermediate has no plane of symmetry - 2 distinct stereoisomers C. There is no difference between the 2 possible sites for nucleophilic attack in each intermediate – Must explore attack at each – All 4 attack routes are equally likely, but all lead to one isomer, the meso compound Bromination of (Z)-2-butene A. Again, no distinction between the 2 faces of the alkene - consider attack from both sides B. The 3-membered ring intermediate has a plane of symmetry. There is only one species for the nucleophile to attack C. There is no difference between the 2 possible sites for nucleophilic attack in the intermediate – One attack leads to one compound, the other to its enantiomer - i.e. get a racemic mixture (Verify this for yourself) Addition in Steroids In a steroid: • Have facial selectivity • Initial attack is preferentially on the least hindered (-face) of the molecule • With cholesterol: Question: “Does Br:– attack at C-5, the centre which can best accommodate + (SN1 like), or does it attack at C-6, the centre which is less sterically hindered (SN2 like)?” See Structure Elucidation Problem C HO Br2 HO Br Lecture Problem An alkene may be converted into an alcohol with overall anti addition of \"H\" and \"OH\": With androst-1-ene, the possible alcohol products (stereochemistry not shown) are: • Draw chair structures for the two possible alcohols showing the orientation of the OH in each case • Explain how NMR could be used to distinguish these H 1.
