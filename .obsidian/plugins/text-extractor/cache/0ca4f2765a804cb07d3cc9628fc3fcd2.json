Escher Cover CHEM202 Ease of Access Synthesis Design A dibromide may be converted into an alkene with I:- in an E2 reaction: Which dibromide (A or B) would you use to make (Z)-2-butene? Br Br I + Br + IBr 32 BrBr H H CH3H3C BrBr H CH3 HH3C achiral form (A) chiral form (B) Steps: • Draw a Newman projection along the 2,3-bond. • Draw a Newman projection with anti-periplanar Br, C-2, C-3, Br. • Deduce the relative orientations of the CH3 groups. Ease of Access In SN2 (CHEM 191), ease of access to the back side of the reactant is a key factor: • Large groups attached to the carbon under attack slow the reaction • Similar control is common in other reactions • This is particularly so in reactions of cyclohexane derivatives XNu Ease of Access in Cyclohexane Derivatives • Shows up in the relative reactivity of pairs of epimers • The key to recognising this control: – The reagent attacks at a centre outside ring - exocyclic attack • Controlling influence - different environments of axial and equatorial groups: – Axial attack is partially blocked by other axial groups on same side of the ring, i.e. groups in a 1,3-cis relationship – Equatorial groups are much more accessible XH Haccess blocked access open X access open Esterification of Alcohols Alcohol + acid halide  ester (acetate as shown) (CHEM 191): Mechanism For a cyclohexanol: • The R group contains the cyclohexane ring • In the rate controlling step, the acid chloride must collide with the oxygen of the alcohol • Attack is at an exocyclic centre (outside the ring) • Ease of access is important • An equatorial alcohol esterifies faster than its axial epimer ROH + CH3COCl → ROCOCH3 + HCl attack exocyclic Hydrolysis of Esters The reverse reaction, ester hydrolysis, is under similar control (CHEM 191): Mechanism The key attack is at an exocyclic centre • Equatorial esters react faster than axial • Thus, if an alcohol esterifies rapidly, its ester will also hydrolyse rapidly ROCOCH3 + HO: - → ROH + CH3COO: - Simple Cyclohexanols Compare esterification of cis and trans-4-tert butylcyclohexanol: • The bulky tert-butyl group must be equatorial • The form with an axial tert-butyl group is destabilised by 1,3- diaxial interactions • Thus, there is only one chair form for each reactant • Trans-isomer: – Has a less hindered equatorial OH – Will esterify quickly • Cis-isomer: – Has a more hindered axial OH – Will esterify slowly • Analysis of systems that can interconvert chairs is complicated (CH3)3C eq OH eq(CH3)3C eq OH ax Steroidal Reactions • The same concepts apply to analysis of exocyclic reactions in steroids • A simplification - steroids do not show chair-chair interconversion • Thus, one can state unequivocally whether a particular substituent is axial or equatorial Examples of Steroidal Reactions Conformational analysis can: • Predict relative rates of reaction for a pair of epimers: e.g androstan-2-ol epimers • Predict relative ease of reaction for different positions in steroid nucleus e.g. androstan-3-ol and androstan-11-ol Help to assess the likely success of a selective functionalization of a polyfunctional molecule e.g. androstane-3,11-diol How to Selectively Acetylate a Diol • Operate at the lowest possible temperature to: – maximize selectivity – avoid unwanted side- reactions • Follow the progress of the reaction carefully, e.g. by thin- layer chromatography (TLC) starting material reaction mixturediol hydroxy acetate 1 hydroxy acetate 2 diacetate Lecture Problem How would you make 11-acetoxyandrostan-3-ol from androstane-3,11-diol?","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
