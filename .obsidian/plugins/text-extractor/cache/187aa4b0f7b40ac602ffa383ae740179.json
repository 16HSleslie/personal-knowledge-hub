I= Integration gives the number of protons of each kind by using the integrated area. P= Position δ value gives information about the environment. Tables of chemical shift values are available for comparison S= Splitting Pattern gives information about the number of protons on the adjacent C atoms. 102 1H NMR of vinyl acetate 103104 15 Hz 10 Hz 3 Hz Each signal is a doublet of doublets (dd) i.e. the signal is split into a doublet twice, with a corresponding coupling constant J (splitting gap) for each split 105 Splitting by multiple non equivalent neighbours 106107 1H NMR of C5H10O 108 1H NMR of C7H14O 109 Online Resources Structure elucidation problem sets (Notre Dame) Organic Chemistry Online: - Spectroscopy Blackboard Lectures/ Module 1: Structural Characterisation and Analysis 110","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
