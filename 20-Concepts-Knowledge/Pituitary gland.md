## Location & structure
The pituitary gland is located at the base of the (brain behind the nose) attached to the bottom of the hypothalamus. it is seperated into 2 sections a posterior and anterior lobe

## Functional overview
**Posterior pituitary gland/lobe**: Connected to the hypothalamus via neurons (cell bodies in hypothalamus, axons terminating in the posterior lobe). Action potentials originating in the hypothalamus stimulate the release of specific hormones from the axon terminals in the posterior lobe into circulation  
**Anterior pituitary gland/lobe**: Connected to the hypothalamus via blood vessels. neural input stimulates neurons in the hypothalamus to secrete hormones which travel via blood vessels to anterior lobe where they bind to specific receptors, stimulating those cells of the anterior pituitary to secrete stored hormones into circulation
