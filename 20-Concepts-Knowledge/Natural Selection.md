Charles Darwin proposed the idea of natural selection as a mechanism of evolution. The 4 things required for natural selection are:
- Variation - individuals in a population vary from one another
- Inheritance - parents pass on their traits to their offspring genetically
- Selection - Some variants reproduce more than others
- Time - successful variation accumulate over time
