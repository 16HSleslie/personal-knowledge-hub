| Chemical classification | Peptides &<br>Catecholamines                       | Steroids                                                                                                                                 |
| Storage                 | Stored until required & released<br>via exocytosis | Steroids are made from cholesterol as<br>required (not stored):<br>Thyroid hormones are made in thyroid<br>cells & stored until required |
| Transport               | Dissolved in blood                                 | Must be bound to a carrior-protein                                                                                                       |
