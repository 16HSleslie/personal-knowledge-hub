Immunology has led to important medical advances … that help protect and/or treat: • Influenza/COVID-19 • Common cold • Tuberculosis • HIV • Allergy • Asthma • Diabetes • Arthritis • Multiple sclerosis • Cancer … 2 Objectives To be able to:  Define how the immune system protects the body  Describe the main features of the human lymphatic system  Describe the physical and chemical barriers that prevent pathogen entry into the human body  List the main features of the 2 arms of the immune system (innate and adaptive) Readings:  Martini Global edition 3e Module 20.1 p793  Marieb 10e Chapter 21 pages 791-793 (until the end of section 21.1, including Figure 21.1 and Table 21.1) 3 Obj 1. Define the Immune System 4 What is immunology?  The study of an organism’s defense system (immune system) in health and disease.  The immune system is composed of:  Organs (eg spleen)  Cells (eg T cells)  Molecules (eg antibodies) 5 What is the immune system?  An organised system of organs, cells and molecules that interact together to defend the body against disease (eg pathogenic microorganisms and cancer). 6 Why is immunology important? Examples of diseases affected by the immune response:  Infectious Diseases  HIV/AIDS  Tuberculosis  Influenza  Malaria  SARS-CoV-2  Inflammatory Diseases  Arthritis/Rheumatism  Allergy/Asthma  Lupus  Diabetes  Crohn’s Disease/ Inflammatory Bowel Disease  Multiple sclerosis  Cancer David Vetter “Boy in the Bubble” 7 What are microbes?  Viruses  Bacteria  Fungi  Protozoa Some microbes are pathogens (disease-causing) Microbes Smaller (nm) Larger (mm) Pathogens 8 Obj 2. The lymphatic system 9 Organs of the immune system Spleen Thymus Bone marrow Lymph nodes • Primary and secondary lymphoid organs • Primary: production of white blood cells (lymphocytes) • Secondary: sites where immune responses are initiated Tonsils Martini 3e Fig 20.1 10 Primary lymphoid organs Thymus • ‘school’ for white blood cells called T cells • developing T cells learn not to react to self Bone marrow • Source of stem cells that develop into cells of the ‘innate’ and ‘adaptive’ immune responses 11 Secondary lymphoid organs Lymph nodes • Located along lymphatic vessels • Lymph fluid from blood and tissue is filtered • Site of initiation of immune responses Spleen • site of initiation for immune responses against blood-borne pathogens 12 The medieval castle as a model for the immune system: 3 layers of defense 1 2 3 1= chemical and physical barriers 2= innate ‘arm’ 3= adaptive ‘arm’ 13 Obj 3. Physical and chemical barriers Skin and mucosal surfaces 14 Physical Barrier: The Skin Cross section through skin Martini 3e Page 226-7 epidermis dermis dendritic cell (immune cells) in this layer Epidermis: Dead cells, keratin and phagocytic immune cells Dermis: Thick layer of connective tissue, collagen and blood vessels and phagocytic immune cells Constant renewal of outer layer 15 Chemical defenses of the skin  Antimicrobial peptides e.g. skin ‘defensins’ – forms pores in microbial cell membranes  Lysozyme: breaks down bacterial cell walls  Sebum: low pH  Salt: hypertonic Sweat gland Sebaceous gland Cross-section through skin Martini 3e pg225 Pore of sweat gland duct 16 Mucous Membranes  1-2 layers  Epithelium: tightly packed live cells, constantly renewed, mucus-producing goblet cells Mucous-producing goblet cellMartini 3e pg210 Martini 3e pg199 17 Mucosal Membranes  Where are they? Mucosal membranes line parts of the body that lead to the outside and are exposed to air Personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent COVID-19 18 The mucociliary escalator Cilia move mucus up to the pharynx Dust particle Mucus Cilia Goblet cell Columnar cell Mucous gland Basement membrane Martini 3e pg840 19 Chemical defenses of mucosal surfaces  Stomach – low pH  Gall bladder – bile  Intestine – digestive enzymes  Mucus  Defensins  Lysozyme (tears, urine) 20 Summary: skin vs mucous membranes Skin Mucous membranes Number of cell layers Many 1 to a few Tightly packed cells? Yes Yes Cells dead or alive? Outer layers dead; inner layers alive Alive Mucus present? No Yes Lysozyme and defensins present? Yes In some cases Sebum present? Yes No Cilia present? No In trachea and uterine tubes 21 Obj 4. Innate vs Adaptive Immunity 22 Two intertwined ‘arms’ of the immune system Figure 21.1 Marieb 23  Innate immunity  Already in place  Rapid (hours)  Fixed  Limited specificities  Has no specific memory  Adaptive immunity  Improves during the response  Slow (days → weeks)  Variable  Highly specific  Has long-term specific memory Two intertwined ‘arms’ of the immune system 24 Innate Immunity • Already in place • Rapid (hours) • Fixed • Limited specificities (detects molecular components shared by many pathogens) • Has no specific memory 25 Adaptive Immunity • Improves during the response • Slow (days → weeks) • Variable • Highly specific (detects molecular components specific to individual pathogens) • Has memory 26 HUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
