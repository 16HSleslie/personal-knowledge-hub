Escher Stars Anchor Groups and Fused Ring Systems CHEM202 Favorskii Rearrangement Suggest a mechanism for the following reaction: O Br COOEt Et = C2H5 OEt Cyclohexane • Rapidly interconverting system • 2 dominant chair conformations • Various boat and twist forms • Each chair has two unique sets of C-H bonds: – axial – equatorial Monosubstituted Cyclohexanes • The 2 chair forms can be distinguished • That with the equatorial group has fewer steric interactions • The system rapidly interconverts, with the equatorial form predominating • Analysis of a chemical reaction on a changing system is very difficult - common to lock the conformation in some way: – use of anchor groups – fused ring systems RH H axial R R equatorial R Anchor Groups • An anchor group is a large substituent, such as a tert-butyl group, -C(CH3)3 • It restricts the system to the chair form with the big group equatorial • When tert-butyl group is present another smaller group can be forced into an axial orientation Axial Vs Equatorial (NEF) X K Energy diff. kJ/mol % eq H 1 0 50 OMe 2.7 2.5 73 Me 19 7.3 95 Et 20 7.5 95 i-Pr 42 9.3 98 t-Bu >3000 >20 >99.9 Ph 110 11.7 99 K = [eq]/[ax] Fused Cyclohexanes • 2 Rings are fused when they share a bond • 2 Cyclohexane rings can be fused 2 ways – i.e. get 2 geometric isomers – The cis-isomer can flip from chair to chair – The trans-isomer cannot flip each ring constrains the other so that it cannot orient itself to have 2 bonds axial – the bonding linkage is too short to allow this • Trans-fusion is common in the steroids Steroids Fused system with 3 x 6-membered rings and 1 x 5-membered ring: Note: • Rings are labelled A, B, C, and D • Carbons are labelled by position numbers • Usually have: – trans-fused rings – methyl groupings at C-10 and C-13 A B C D1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 10 11 12 13 17 16 1514 Androstane Skeleton -face 10 13 CH3 CH3 H H H H Note: • The ring system is relatively flat • The side to which methyls point is called the -face • The other side is the -face -face Shorthand Conventions For simplicity, abbreviated structures are often drawn: • CH3 groups are represented as lines • Focus is directed to the part of the molecule of interest by the use of partial structures e.g. androstan-3-ol: 2 3 1 H HO or 2 3 1 HOH Epimers • A typical steroid has several chiral carbons – carbons with each of the 4 bonds attached to something different • Epimers are isomers that differ at only one of these chiral carbons • E.g. the 3-epimer of androstan-3-ol is androstan-3-ol • Epimers are diastereoisomers – they are not related as mirror images – they have different physical propertiesH HO H HO androstan-3-ol androstan-3-ol Important – Trans-fused Steroids Cannot Flip • The 6-membered rings of a trans-fused steroid are fixed in one chair form • Therefore it is possible to say with certainty whether an individual grouping is axial or equatorial • E.g. androstan-2-ol must have an equatorial OH group 1 2 H HO What about 7-bromoandrostane? Use of NMR Two of the features of NMR that provide useful information about the stereochemistry of groups are: 1. Analysis of coupling patterns • Note –CH-CH2- gives a triplet in simple compounds (n+1 rule) • In ring systems the two CH2 signals are often non-equivalent and a double-doublet is observed: 2. Comparison of chemical shifts J1 J2 J2 1. Analysis of Coupling Patterns Coupling constant, J, depends on the dihedral angle (Karplus equation) Dihedral angle 180o 60o 60o Typical J (Hz) ~10 3-5 3-5 H H dihedral angle Hax Hax Hax Heq Heq Heq Androstan-3-ol • The OH is equatorial so H-3 is axial • Build a splitting tree by considering each coupling in turn – J3,2 - axial/axial (~10 Hz) – J3,4 - axial/axial (~10 Hz) – J3,2 - axial/equatorial (~5 Hz) – J3,4 - axial/equatorial (~5 Hz) • Predictions: – a 7 line pattern – a bandwidth ~30 Hz 1010 105 5 55 5 5 5 5 5 Exercise – 1 2 3 4 H HO H HH HH the 3a-epimer exhibits a 5 line pattern with band width ~20 Hz. Verify this using J values of 5 Hz for eq/eq and eq/ax couplings 2. Comparison of Chemical Shifts • 1,3-diaxial interactions are deshielding - result in downfield shifts (away from TMS) - e.g. epimeric 2-bromoandrostanes • equatorial Br • CH3 signal not deshielded • axial Br • CH3 signal deshielded 102 CH3 H Br 2-bromoandrostane 102 CH3 H Br 1,3-diaxial interaction 2-bromoandrostane","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
