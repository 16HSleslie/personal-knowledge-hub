**T cell precursors** are produced in the *bone marrow* and migrate to the **thymus**, once in the thymus **T cell receptors (TCR)** under go *gene rearrangement* and this produces diversity among T cells.

### Explanation
In the thymus, immature T cells (**thymocytes**) undergo *random V(D)J gene rearrangement* of their TCR genes. This process generates a unique TCR for each T cell, enabling recognition of a vast array of antigens
