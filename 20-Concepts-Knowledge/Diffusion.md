Diffusion is the movement of particles so that they spread out into the available space. Diffusion follows a simple rule; a substance will diffuse from where it is more concentrated to where is less concentrated.
Put in another way, any substance will diffuse down its concentration gradient, without any energy required. In the context of a biological plasma membrane, membranes are permeable to lipid-soluble molecules, they will move
down their concentration gradient across the membrane
