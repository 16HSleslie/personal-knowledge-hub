Escher Relativity CHEM202 Conformation, Rings & Ring Strain Tips and Suggestions • Bring paper • Pyramidal learning structure… you snooze you lose! • If something is not clear get help • NEF, don’t get caught up Aims of the Course 1. How does molecular shape and orientation of groups influence chemical reactivity? CHEM 191 - typical reactions of functional groups CHEM 111 - molecular shape (configuration & conformation) This course - molecular shape does exert a secondary influence on the reactivity of functional groups (CH3)3C eq OH eq(CH3)3C eq OH ax Trans-isomer: Has a less hindered equatorial OH, will esterify faster than cis-isomer (ax-OH) Aims of the Course, cont.. 2. Can stereochemical principles be used in the design of selective syntheses? • formation of one specific stereoisomer (stereoselectivity) • manipulation of one of a set of potential reaction sites (regioselectivity) CH3(CH2)10CH3COO sex attractant (CH2)10CH3COO inhibits sexual attraction CH3Red-banded leaf roller HO CH3 H H H OH OH CH3 H H3C CH2CH2COOH cholic acid - human bile The story so far • Mainly interested in the shape of small localised atoms (think methyl group, ketone etc) • On larger scale, shape is not so easily defined, rotation about single bonds is possible => lots of possible shapes (conformations) • Flash back/quick review (Newman, saw-horse projections) Conformation e.g. C atom with 4 single bonds: • bond angles ~109o • C-C bonds ~1.54 Å Deviations indicate some strain Molecular shape dictated by: • optimum bond lengths • optimum bond angles for constituent atoms Within these constraints, most molecules adopt various shapes by rotation about single bonds – gives various conformations C C 1.54Å 109 o bond in plane of page bond to back bond to front Conformation and Configuration Change conformation  new shape When the energy barrier is small you cannot isolate individual conformations, e.g. butane: • anti form is preferred • at room temperature have free rotation • properties are those of the mixture of various forms Change configuration  new substance, a stereoisomer • different forms can be isolated • have some physical differences: – enantiomers –non-identical mirror images – have different effect on plane polarised light – diastereoisomers – not mirror images – differ in most physical properties Putting it together • Structures that can be interconverted simply by rotation are conformations of the same molecule. • Structures that can interconverted only by breaking one or more bonds have different configurations, and are stereoisomers The Border Between Conformation and Configuration - 1 If the energy barrier is large (> ~80 kJ mol-1), the distinction between conformation and configuration blurs - e.g. biphenyl: • Have free rotation about the C-C bond  many conformations • But - with large groups in the ortho-positions, rotation can be blocked The Border Between Conformation and Configuration - 2 • If X  Y and A  B there is no plane of symmetry • The molecule and its mirror image are enantiomers • These enantiomers can only interconvert by rotation about the C-C bond • If the energy barrier to rotation is large (large A, B, X and Y) enantiomers (conformations?) can be isolated X Y A B Rates and barriers: the guidelines (NEF!!) • A barrier of 73 kJ/mol allows a rotation every second at 25 C • Every 6 kJ/mol changes the rate at 25 C by a factor ~10 • To see signals in an NMR spectrum for two different conformations, they must interconvert <~1000 s-1 (a barrier of roughly 55 kJ/mol at 25 C) Can you draw the expected 1H NMR spectrum of DMF? Molecular Mechanics For molecules with >1 bond capable of free rotation: • Difficult to assess relative energies of conformations • Use computer programs that perform molecular mechanics calculations • Procedure: – Draw approximate structure – The computer then: • Calculates a strain energy • Makes small change to the geometry and calculates a new strain energy • Repeats the process until any further changes always result in an increase in strain E • Have found a local minimum Energy Surface • Picture of all conformations available • Local minima lie in depressions • Most favoured conformation - global minimum e.g. for butane (2 different C-C bonds): 1 22 3 Local minimum Global minimum To find global minimum: • Use many different starting geometries • Compare energies of all local minima obtained • Called conformational searching Cyclic Molecules Represent as regular polygons Each unspecified vertex is a C with enough H to give 4 bonds Name by adding cyclo to alkane name Molecular shapes dictated by minimisation of: – Bond Angle Strain - bond angles will be as close as possible to the ideal – Torsional Strain - adjacent bonds will be as close to staggered as possible – Van der Waals Interactions - close approach of non-bonded atoms will be avoided if possible (a) Bond Angle Strain Only significant in smaller rings Cyclopropane: • must be planar • bond angles within ring are 60o - considerable strain Cyclobutane: • 90o bond angles if planar • slight bending makes angles a little larger • non-planar structure with considerable bond angle strain Higher cycloalkanes: • all non-planar • relatively unstrained bond angles, close to 109o60 o puckered conformation (b) Torsional Strain - 1 Resistance to bond twisting Cyclopropane: • planar • all bonds eclipsed • high torsional strain Cyclobutane - nearly planar, almost eclipsed H CH2 H H CH2 H (b) Torsional Strain - 2 Cyclohexane: • chair form – ideal, all bonds staggered • boat - 2 sides with eclipsing bonds H H CH2 CH2 H H Higher cycloalkanes: • many conformations with most bonds staggered • usually can’t have all bonds fully staggered CH2 H CH2 H H H (c) Van der Waals Interactions - 1 3 to 5 membered rings - no significant interactions between groups across the ring Cyclohexane: • chair - 1,3-diaxial interactions 3 1 • boat - stronger 1,4-flagpole interactions 4 1 (c) Van der Waals Interactions - 2 • 7 to 10-membered rings - quite severe interactions - e.g. cyclodecane: • > 10 membered: – more space in centre of ring – interactions less severe H H H H H H H HH H H H H H H H H H H H Strain Variation with Ring Size Considerable variation in strain energy.

One of the most potent explosives known Favoured Ring Size Varies The 6-membered ring is not always the most favoured Some influential factors: • Atoms other than C may have different preferred bond angles • Divalent ring atoms: – have no bonds to become involved in eclipsing – have no attached groupings – less van der Waals interaction – planar conformations may be feasible • Interactions between charged or partially charged centres Molecular modelling is again very helpful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=717vb7kLKKk","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
