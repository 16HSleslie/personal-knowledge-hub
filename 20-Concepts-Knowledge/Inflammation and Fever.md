**Fever (Pyrexia)** sis defined as **abnormally high body temperature (>37Â°C)**

Mechanism:
- The **hypothalamus** resets the body's "thermostat".
- Triggered by **pyrogens**: molecules released mainly by immune cells

Key pathway:
- Phagocytes (especially macrophages) ingest bacteria -> release pyrogenic **cytokines** (notably **interleukin-1 (IL-1)**)
- IL-1 travels to the hypothalamus, inducing fever response.
