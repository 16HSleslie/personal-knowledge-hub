### Helper Functions
**CD4 T** cells coordinate both *humoral* (antibody-mediated) and *cellular* immunity

Explanation:
- CD4 T cells help B cells produce antibodies (humoral immunity)
- They also help CD8 T cells to become CTLs (cellular immunity)
- **Cytokines** such as IL-2 and IL-4 are crucial for these processes

### Cytotoxic Functions
**Cytotoxic T lymphocytes** kill infected or abnormal cells

Explanation:
- CTLs recognise infected cells via TCR binding to MCG-I/peptide
- They release perforin (form pores) and granzyme (induced apoptosis) to destroy target cells.

### Memory T Cells
**Memory T cells** are long-lived and respond rapidly upon re-exposure to antigen

Explanation:
- Both CD4 and CD8 T cells can form memory cells after activation
- Memory T cells provide quicker and stronger responses during secondary infections
