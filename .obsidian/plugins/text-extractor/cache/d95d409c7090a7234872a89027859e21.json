Objectives To be able to:  Describe the key components of the inflammatory response  Describe the 5 stages of phagocytosis  Explain the main features of the complement system Readings:  Marieb 10e Chapter 21 second part of Section 21.2, page 794 (Section Phagocytosis and Figure 21.2)  Marieb 10e Chapter 21 page 795-797 (Section Inflammation: Tissue Response to Injury and Figure 21.3 and 21.4)  Marieb 10e Chapter 21 page 798-799 (Section Complement and Figure 21.6) 2 3 layers of immune defense 1. Physical & Chemical Barriers (skin, mucosal membranes) 2. The Innate Immune System 3. The Adaptive Immune System 3 The inflammatory response Marieb Figure 21.4 Chemical signals from tissue- resident cells act to attract more cells to the site of injury or infection 4 The inflammatory response Marieb Figure 21.4 Neutrophils enter blood from the bone marrow 5 The inflammatory response Marieb Figure 21.4 Neutrophils cling to the capillary wall 6 The inflammatory response Marieb Figure 21.4 Chemical signals from tissue- resident cells dilate blood vessels and make capillaries ‘leakier’ 7 The inflammatory response Marieb Figure 21.4 Neutrophils squeeze through the ‘leaky’ capillary wall and follow the chemical trail to the injury site 8 Many myeloid cells are phagocytic In 1886-87 Elie Metchnikoff discovered the cells in the blood could ingest and destroy microbes – a process called phagocytosis Phagein = Ancient Greek “to devour” 9 Lysosome Acid hydrolase enzymes Phagosome (phagocytic vesicle) Events of phagocytosis. Phagocyte forms pseudopods that eventually engulf the particles, forming a phagosome. 1 2 3 4 5 Phagocyte adheres to pathogens or debris. Lysosome fuses with the phagocytic vesicle, forming a phagolysosome. Toxic compounds and lysosomal enzymes destroy pathogens. Sometimes exocytosis of the vesicle removes indigestible and residual material.
