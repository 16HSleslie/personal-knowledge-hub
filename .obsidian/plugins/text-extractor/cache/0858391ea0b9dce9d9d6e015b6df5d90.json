Normal Range Blood Glucose ATP production Particularly for brain function 3.5 – 6 mmol/L (fasting) 3.5 – 8 mmol/L (non-fasting) Sodium (Na+) ECF volume Action potential generation 135 – 145 mmol/L Calcium (Ca++) Structural component of bone and teeth Neurotransmission and muscle contraction Blood Clotting and enzyme function 2.2 to 2.6 mmol/L Potassium (K+) Main determinant of RMP Nerve and muscle function 3.5 to 5 mmol/L ECF osmolarity Maintanence of normal cell volume 275-300 mosmol/L 4 • ‘Regulated variable’ The variable the system senses and tries to keep stable • e.g. - the speed of a car on a motorway • blood glucose, [Ca++], etc • ‘Set point • i.e. the target value for that variable • e.g. the speed limit of 100 on motorway • BGL 5 mmol/L, [Ca++] 2.4 mmol/L • ‘Reference range’ • Values of the regulated variable within ‘normal’ limits • e.g. what speeds most ‘normal’ people are driving between (80-110 kmph)? • BGL 3.5 – 6 mmol/L (fasting), [Ca++] 2.2 - 2.6 mmol/L d limit Important Homeostatic Terminology www.rta.nsw.gov.au 100 5 Clinical implications of variability 6Time 8 3.5 Normal Set Point for Blood Glucose *Normal Range (mmol/L) Variation in set points between individuals = inter-individual variation Within an individual, variables fluctuate around the set point in response to normal activity= INTRA individual variation * Approximate non-fasting BGL (Adated from Figure 1-11, p19, Patton & Thibodeau, 8 th edition) 6 Monthly Rhythm Normal fluctuation in levels of several Hormones and body temperature Circadian Rhythm: Cycles of 24 hours 7 • Measurements obtained from healthy group of people, and assuming values are normally distributed. • Values within two standard deviations of the mean are considered ‘normal’ • i.e. 95% of measurements from healthy people will be within 2 standard deviations of the average (mean) for that variable Reference (normal) ranges for physiological variables 2SD 2SD 8 By chance, 5% of tests outside the reference range might be from people who are actually healthy Reference Range In this example is 36.7 to 37.50C 8 Credit: Wikimedia.org Control centre Effectors Sensors Variable Stimulus Homeostatic Control Systems - Negative Feedback (opposes change and move regulated variable back toward its set point. Most Common) Components of a negative feedback system: • Sensors: monitor the regulated variable and detects deviation from set-point • Control centre or integrator: compares the variable’s actual value to the set-point. • Sends signals via communication pathways to effectors if correction is required. • Effectors: act to oppose the effect of the stimulus, thereby correcting the change and restoring the variable to its set-point. 9 Opposes effect of stimulus Note: Sensor and integrator can be the same cell Communication pathways carry signal between components e.g. nerves or hormones in blood 9 Exercise in Hot weather Core temperature Increases to 39 0C Central thermoreceptors (neurons) in brain Heat loss centre in hypothalamus Sweat Glands produce sweat and skin blood vessels dilate • Sensors: Thermoreceptors (neurons) in brain detect increased blood temperature • Control centre/integrator: Brain compares actual temp (40℃) to set-point of 37℃; then send signals to effectors via Communication pathways (nerves) • Effectors: • sweat glands >> evaporative heat loss • Blood vessels in skin dilate to facilitate heat loss to environment via conduction, convection and radiation Physiological Negative Feedback ExampleTemp moved back toward set point 10 Positive feedback (less common) • is a response to a stimulus that moves the variable further away from the ‘set point’ i.e. it reinforces the initial change • Useful when a process needs to be driven to completion. • Need to be carefully controlled to limit outcome. 11 Adapted from: Patton & Thibodeau Anatomy & Physiology 7th Ed .Box 1-3 Mosby items and derived items © 2010, 2007, 2003 by Mosby, Inc., an affiliate of Elsevier Inc Baby moves into birth canalPositive feedback Example 2 – Childbirth (partuition) 12 Feed forward Homeostatic Control • Involves detection or anticipation of conditions that could disrupt homeostasis if some sort of PREMPTIVE action was not taken • Based on information received, the integration centre establishes a future ‘predicted value’ for the regulated variable, compares this with the ‘set-point’ and makes anticipatory corrections. • Examples: - shivering as you enter a cold environment (physiological feed-forward) - Putting on more clothes if it looks cold outside (behavioural feed-forward) 13 14 Nervous system vs Endocrine system Bloodstream Hormones (chemicals released by endocrine cells) Chemically-gated ion channels on the post- synaptic membrane. Neurons Neurotransmitter Chemical synapse. Commons.Wikimedia.org Hormones (chemicals released by endocrine cells) Endocrine cells Nervous system: • Neurons produce APs and release neurotransmitter at synapses (with other neurons, muscle or glands) • Neurotransmitter binds to receptors on post-synaptic cell • - often chemically gated ion channels e.g. nicotinic AChRs but can be to G protein coupled receptors too. • Typically very fast signaling Endocrine system: • Most hormones are circulating hormones i.e. secreted initially into the interstitial fluid then diffuse into blood to be transported to target tissue(s) • Hormones bind to membrane or intracellular receptors of target cells – affect any cells with correct receptors • Relatively slower, but generally longer lasting and more widespread action compared to the nervous system 14 Local Hormones • act locally on other nearby cells (paracrines), or sometimes on the same cell that secreted them (autocrines). • Examples include: - Prostaglandins involved in inflammation and pain - Derived from arachidonic acid (20 carbon fatty acid) - cytokines released by white blood cells during immune responses Arachidonic Acid 15 Chemical classes of Hormones.. 1. Amino acid derivatives • Synthesised by modifying particular amino acids • Tyrosine >> catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine) • Tyrosine >> thyroid hormones (lipid soluble) • Tryptophan >> serotonin and melatonin • Histadine >> histamine 16 2. Peptide Hormones and protein hormones (generally water soluble) • Peptide hormones - chains of 3 to 49 amino acids Ø e.g antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin • Protein hormones – chains of 50 to 200 amino acids Ø human growth hormone (hGH), insulin and prolactin (PRL) ØSome may have carbohydrate groups attached in which case they may be referred to as ‘glycoprotein hormones’ hGH 17 Protein and peptide hormone are synthesized on ribosomes of RER 1st as larger preprohormones that are not biologically active (but may contain aa sequences of various peptides that are) Cleaved to form smaller prohormones in ER Packaged into secretory vesicles in Golgi apparatus. During this process enzymes in vesicles cleave prohormones to produced active hormone and inactive fragments Active hormone and inactive fragments secreted via exocytosis Source: Molina P.E ; Endocrine Physiology, 4th Edn. www.accessmedicine.com. McGraw –Hill Companies Inc. 18 3. Lipid Derivatives (generally sythesized as needed i.e. not stored) Steroid hormones • Derived from cholesterol (therefore lipid soluble) • Differences in the chemical groups attached at various sites on the 4 ring structure are responsible for producing diverse effects • Bound to specific transport proteins in blood so remain in circulation longer than peptide hormones estradioltestosterone Aldosteronecortisol cholesterol 19 Mechanisms of Hormone action • The response to a hormone depends on: (a) the hormone itself and (b) the particular target cells - what receptors are present - their ‘intracellular machinery’ • The same hormone can produce different effects in different cells: • E.g insulin causes glycogen synthesis in muscle but synthesis of triglycerides in adipose tissue • To have an effect, a hormone must first bind to receptors on the target cell(s) which are in the cell membrane (for water soluble hormones) or in the cytoplasm or nucleus for lipid soluble hormones)… Cell D Different Response 20 1. 'free’ lipid soluble hormone molecule diffuses from blood to interstitial fluid and then through the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane 2. Hormone binds to receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus. 3. The activated receptor-hormone then binds to steroid response elements (SRE) on DNA. 4. Gene expression altered by switching specific genes on or off. 5. New mRNA is transcribed and moves to ribosomes 6. mRNA translated on ribosomes to produce new proteins >> altered cell structure and/or function 21 'free’ thyroid hormone molecule diffuses from blood to interstitial fluid and then through the lipid bilayer Hormone binds to receptors in the mitochondria or nucleus. - increased energy production (mitochondria) - Altered gene activation (nucleus) and protein production on RER >> altered cell structure and/or function 22 Action of water soluble hormones • Amine, peptide and protein hormones are generally not lipid soluble so their receptors are integral membrane proteins at the cell surface. • The hormone binds to these receptors acting as a ‘first messenger’ • The activated receptor (via its coupling to a G protein) then causes the production of a ‘second messenger’ inside the cell • *AC = adenylate cyclase • 2nd messengers include cyclic AMP (cAMP), calcium ions (Ca++) and others G *AC+ ATP Hormone = ‘first messenger” ‘second messenger’ 23 G-protein coupled receptors • Transmembrane proteins (with 7 membrane spanning domains) • Intracellular domains coupled to G-proteins that can bind guanosine nucleotides (GTP and GDP) • Binding of hormone to receptor (externally) activates G-protein (internally) • G-protein subunit can then activate enzymes on inner cell membrane (e.g. adenylate cyclase) to produce a ‘second’ messenger (e.g. cyclic AMP) • …OR…alter activity of ion channels (e.g. open Ca++ channels) so that Ca++ acts as ‘second messenger’ • Second messengers or calcium-calmodulin can then switch on or off various enzymes within the cell… This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA G-protein GDP GTP HORMONE 24 G AC GDP ⍺ ATP cAMP Protein Kinase A Enz P Enz P Enz P Enz P Enz P Enz P Enz P Enz P GTP ⍺ Ca++ Calmodulin Activation of Enzymes Intracellular Effects ⍺ GTP SIGNAL AMPLIFICATION!
