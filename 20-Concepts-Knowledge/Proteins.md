Proteins are instrumental in almost everything that organism do. Some proteins speed up chemical reactions (enzymes), whiles other play a role in defence, storage, transport, cellular communication, movement, or structural support.
They are constructed from the same 20 amino acids, linked in unbranched polymers. The bonds between amino acids is called a peptide bond, so a polymer of amino acids is called polypeptide.

Example of proteins that carry out different functions include:
- Collagen (structural)
- Insulin (regulatory)
- Actin and myosin (contractile)
- Haemoglobin (transport)
- Albumin (storage)
- IgG (protective)
- RNA polymerase (catalytic)
- Botulinum (toxic)
