Lecture Objectives (Updated) - Outline the importance of plasma glucose homeostasis - Be able to state typical reference range for fasting and non-fasting glucose concentration. - Describe the location and structure of the pancreas and name the hormones produced by the alpha and beta cells. - Understand the effects of insulin and glucagon on muscle, adipose and the liver. - Outline the difference between the fed and fasting metabolic states. - Understand how insulin and glucagon work together to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. - Outline the causes of diabetes mellitus and the potential consequences if not adequately treated - Briefly outline how diabetes may be treated and managed 2 • Normal reference range for plasma glucose concentration • 3.5 to 6 mmol/L (fasting) • 3.5 to 8 mmol/L(non-fasting) Note: Textbook uses different units ie 70-110 mg/dL • Why is blood glucose concentration so important? • brain cells are largely dependent on glucose as energy source • other cells are better able to use alternative substrates for ATP production when glucose levels are low. • Prolonged HIGH blood glucose causes its own problems in various organs 3 • The PANCREAS is located in curve of duodenum and consists of head, body and tail • 99% of pancreatic cells are clustered into acini that secrete enzymes into ducts which empty into intestine i.e exocrine glands • Small clusters of endocrine cells scattered amongst acini = pancreatic islets or Islets of Langerhan’s. • There are normally 1-2 million islets in the human pancreas…… 4 © 2018 Pearson Education, Ltd. Alpha cells - Secrete glucagon - Increases BGL Beta cells - Secrete insulin - Reduces BGL Delta cells Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP cells) 5 Insulin • Protein hormone Initially synthesized on RER of beta cells as preprohormone with A, B and C chains • C chain removed in Golgi apparatus and packaged into secretory vesicles • Insulin (and C peptide) released from beta cells when BGLs rise • Circulates unbound in plasma and mostly cleared from circulation within 10-15 minutes 6 Bloodstream Reference: Chaurasiya, A., Singh, R., & Shah, A. (2020).Interaction between oxidative stress and diabetes: a mini-review. Journal of Diabetes & Metabolic Disorders, 7(2), p59 Fig1. Activation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 by insulin. Insulin corrects hyperglycemia by facilitating glucose uptake into cells of most body tissues Without insulin, glucose can’t be utilized by most cells for energy AND blood glucose levels will be too high 7 Insulin Receptors (member of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases)• Insulin binds to alpha subunits • beta subunits then get phosphate groups attached from ATP • Beta subunits then able to phosphorylate proteins inside the cell that mediate insulins effects • Insulin response substrates • Insertion of GLUT4 transporters into cell membrane of muscle and fat cells • Activation/inactivation of specific enzymes pathways in various cells • The exact effect will depend on the type of cell α subunits β subunits Insulin-binding domain Tyrosine Kinase domain Insulin Response Substrates ATP ADP P Glucose transport Protein synthesis Fat synthesis Glycogen synthesis Glucose GLUT4 8 Effects of Insulin on Skeletal Muscle • Increased glucose entry into muscle cells via GLUT4 (insulin dependent) • Increased glycogen synthesis in muscles • (assuming not exercising at the same time) • Increased transport of amino acids into muscle (and other cells) • Increased protein synthesis • Inhibition of protein breakdown Note: When glucose and insulin levels low, muscle uses fatty acids for energy ØExercise itself causes translocation of GLUT4 to cell membrane in skeletal muscle This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA-NC This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND Glycogen 9 • Increased glucose transport into adipose cells via GLUT4 (facilitated diffusion) • Increased synthesis and storage of triacylglycerides • Insulin inhibits lipolysis (TAGs to fatty acids) Effects of Insulin on Adipose (fat tissue) https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/facilitated-transport Specific molecule such as glucose binds to receptor site on the integral membrane protein transporter Shape of the protein then changes, moving the molecule across the plasma membrane. 10 Effects of Insulin on Liver 1. uptake of glucose and conversion to glycogen. • Entry of glucose into hepatocytes is mainly via GLUT2 • (insulin independent) 2. Fatty acid synthesis • When the quantity of glucose entering liver cells is more than can be stored as glycogen (or used for hepatocyte metabolism) then insulin promotes conversion of excess glucose into fatty acids. • Fatty acids packaged into VLDL as triglyceride • VLDL enters blood and transports triglycerides to other tissues 11 Effects of Insulin on Liver… 3. Inhibits glycogenolysis • (breakdown of glycogen to glucose) 4. Inhibits gluconeogenesis • (production of ‘new’ glucose from non-carbohydrate sources e.g. amino acids, glycerol, lactate) 5. Suppresses the formation of ketone bodies (acetoacetic acid, beta-hydroxybutyric acid and acetone) exhaled Utilized by other cells for ATP production 12 • Insulin can be thought of as “signalling that the body has been fed” • Promotes uptake and storage of nutrients • Glucose → glycogen (muscle and liver) • Glucose → fatty acids and triclycerides (adipose and liver) • amino acids → protein (muscle and various other cells) • Conversely, if there is no insulin then the body behaves as if it is “starved” • Mobilizing glycogen stores in muscle and liver • Breaking down protein to its constituent amino acids which can be used for energy or to make new glucose in the liver (gluconeogenesis) • Mobilizing fat stores to increase lipids levels in blood • Increasing ketone production which can be used by various tissues (including brain) as an energy source – ‘glucose sparing’ 13 Glucagon • Polypeptide hormone secreted by alpha cells of pancreatic islets primarily in response to HYPOGLYCEMIA (low blood glucose) • Exercise can also stimulate glucagon secretion • Glucagon exerts its effects (primarily on the liver) via activation of receptors that utilize cAMP as second messenger.

Promote production of “new glucose” by hepatocytes (gluconeogenesis) 3. Promote release of glucose from liver cells into blood 4. Promote breakdown of triglycerides and release of fatty acids from adipose 14 HOMEOSTASIS Homeostasis DISTURBED BY DECREASING blood glucose level Receptors Alpha cells in pancreatic islets Pancreas Secrete glucagon Liver, skeletal muscle, adipose cells respond with Increased breakdown of glycogen by the liver and release of glucose into bloodstream Increased breakdown of TAGs to fatty acids (in adipose tissue) Increased synthesis and release of glucose (in liver) NORMAL BLOOD GLUCOSE RANGE STIMULUS RESTORED Homeostasis RESTORED BY INCREASING blood glucose level Effectors Secrete insulin Most body cells respond with Increased rate of glucose transport into target cells Increased rate of glucose use and ATP generation Increased conversion of glucose to glycogen Increased amino acid absorp- tion and protein synthesis Increased triglyceride (fat) synthesis in adipose tissue Homeostasis RESTORED BY DECREASING Receptors Beta cells in pancreatic islets Homeostasis DISTURBED BY INCREASING blood glucose level Pancreas STIMULUS RESTORED blood glucose level Effectors © 2018 Pearson Education, Ltd. Blood Glucose Homeostasis Summary Figure 16.11 3 (3.5 – 6 mmol/L) 15 • ‘Diabetes’ derived from Greek – ‘siphon’ or ‘pass through’ • ‘Mellitus’ derived from Latin for ‘honey’ or ‘sweet’ • Historically referred to a disease state characterized by: • Polyuria (passing large volumes of urine) • Polydipsia (excessive drinking / thirst) • Polyphagia (excessive hunger) “…a chronic affliction characterized by intense thirst and voluminous, honey-sweet urine; the melting of the flesh into urine.” (Aretaeus of Cappadocia, first century AD) Diabetes Mellitus This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA 16 Type I Diabetes Mellitus - Essentially NO insulin production by beta cells Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, thought to be due to some environmental trigger (e.g. viral infection) combined with genetic predisposition Acute Symptoms Type I DM • Passing urine frequently (polyuria) • Very thirsty and drinking lots (polydipsia) • Excessive hunger (polyphagia) • Tiredness • Weight loss • Decreased concentration • Mood changes • Tummy Pain Chronic • Poor healing • Increased infection risk • Cardiovascular Disease • Renal Disease • Diabetic retinopathy • Diabetic neuropathy Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes is INSULIN! (other dietary and exercise management strategies may be involved but NEED INSULIN) 17 Treatment with insulin causes risk of HYPOGLYCEMIA (Symptoms vary among individuals but tend to be consistent for each person) 1. Symptoms related to activation of the SNS • Tachycardia • Palpatations • Diaphoresis • Tremor • Pallor • Anxiety 2. Due to inadequate blood glucose for normal brain function: • Headache • Dizziness • Irritability • Fatigue • Confusion • visual changes • hunger…. 18 https://www.diabetes.org.nz/blog/cgms-and-winz Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) - Subcutaneous BGL sensor transmits to device - Person adjusts s/c insulin dose accordingly CGM coupled to insulin pump - Subcutaneous BGL sensor transmits to device - Pump algorithm adjusts infusion rate accordingly - Can utilise feedforward AND negative feedback 19 Type II Diabetes Mellitus • Reduced sensitivity to the effects of insulin (hyposensitivity) • Common causes : Inactivity, poor diet, obesity • Insulin secretion may be high in early stages (to control high BGL) • Later in disease, beta cells may get ‘worn out’ leading to progressively lower insulin secretion and worsening blood glucose control (hyposecretion) Some other conditions that can cause raised blood glucose include: • Diseases that damage pancreas - Pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis • Some medications (e.g glucocorticoids) https://www.webpathology.com/images/gastrointestinal/pancreas/acute-and-chronic-pancreatitis/43513 20 Treatment of Type II Diabetes 1. Aim to reduce weight by 10-15% in early disease to achieve remission 2.Metformin • improves insulin sensitivity of cells and reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis 3. Drugs that cause glucose to be lost in urine (SGLT2 inhibitors) 4. Drugs that increase insulin secretion - GLP-1 receptor agonists - Sulphonylurea drugs 5. Acarbose - slows down absorption of glucose from intestines 21 Some comparisons between Type 1 and Type II diabetes • Type 1 always requires insulin • In type II there is usually enough insulin secretion to prevent ketosis and weight loss but not hyperglycemia • Both Types I and II can have symptoms of polydipsia and polyuria • Type II may be treated with diet, exercise and oral medications • Type II may also end up requiring insulin to maintain BGL control • Both can result in pathology related to chronic hyperglycemia.. Gestational diabetes may occur in women during pregnancy so important to srceen for this. 22 Pathological effects of chronic hyperglycemia Diabetic Retinopathy Diabetic Nephropathy 23 Atherosclerosis (CAD, PVD, stroke) Diabetic Neuropathy, poor wound healing, infection risk. 24 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
