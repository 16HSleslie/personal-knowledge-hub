## 1. Blood & Immune Cell Overview

  **Key Concepts:**

- **Blood** is a mixture of liquid (plasma) and cells (formed elements).
- **Immune cells** are white blood cells (leukocytes) circulating in the blood.

**Main Components:**

- **Plasma (55% of blood volume):**
    - Contains **proteins** (including antibodies/immunoglobulins), other solutes, and water.
- **Formed elements (45%):**
    - Consist of **platelets**, **white blood cells (leukocytes)**, and **red blood cells (erythrocytes)**.

**Key Visuals or Data:**

**Table: Composition of Whole Blood**

|Component|Percentage|Constituents|
|---|---|---|
|Plasma|55%|Proteins (incl. antibodies), other solutes, water|
|Formed elements|45%|Platelets, White blood cells, Red blood cells|

## 2. Blood Cell Formation (Hematopoiesis)

  **Key Concepts:**

- **Hematopoiesis:** The process of forming new blood cells in the bone marrow from **hematopoietic stem cells**.

**Key Details:**

- All blood cells originate in the **bone marrow**, which houses stem cells.
- Blood cell lineages divide into:
    - **Myeloid lineage:** Gives rise to red blood cells, granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cel ls, and platelets (mostly cells of the innate immune system).
    - **Lymphoid lineage:** Gives rise to B and T lymphocytes (adaptive immune system).

## 3. Types and Functions of Immune Cells in Blood & Tissue

### A. Granulocytes

#### Neutrophils

- **Key Concept:** Most abundant type of white blood cell (about 75% of leukocytes).
- **Function:** Highly **phagocytic**—"eat and kill" pathogens; numbers increase during infection.
- Neutrophils circulate in blood and move into tissues during inflammation.

**Visual:**

#### Mast Cells

- **Distributed** in mucosal tissues, **not found in blood**.
- **Function:** Release granules containing chemicals that attract other white blood cells to areas of tissue damage (**inflammatory initiation**).

**Visual:**

### B. Monocytes & Macrophages

- **Monocytes** are found in the blood; have low phagocytic activity.
- After leaving the blood, monocytes **become macrophages** in tissues (e.g., in the spleen, liver), significantly increasing their phagocytic ability.

**Functions of Macrophages:**

1. **Phagocytosis** ("professional eaters"): Engulf and digest microbial invaders.
2. **Release of chemical messengers:** Help signal and coordinate other immune responses.
3. **Antigen presentation:** Display parts of pathogens to T cells – a crucial link between **innate and adaptive immunity**.

**Visual:**

### C. Dendritic Cells

- Present in **low numbers** but found throughout blood and all tissues in contact with the environment (e.g., skin, mucosa).
- **Phagocytic.**
- **Critical for initiating adaptive immune responses.** They capture antigens and travel to lymph nodes to present them to T cells.

**Visual:**

## 4. Phagocytic Cells

  **Key Concepts:**

- **Phagocytosis:** The process by which certain immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells) engulf and destroy microbes and debris.

**Major Phagocytic Cells:**

- **Neutrophils**
- **Macrophages**
- **Dendritic Cells**

**Importance:**

- Critical first line defence—remove pathogens before infection can spread.
- Initiate signals that attract and coordinate further immune responses.

---

## 5. Movement of Immune Cells: Circulation & Lymphatics

**Key Concepts:**

- **Transport:** Immune cells travel via blood and lymphatic systems.
- **Tissue Exit:** Cells can move from blood into tissues as needed (especially during infection/inflammation).
- **Lymphatic system:** Lymph drains from tissues into lymphatic vessels, which lead to lymph nodes (sites of immune cell congregation and action).

## 6. Recognition of Pathogens by Innate Cells

### A. Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)

**Key Concepts:**

- **PAMPs:** Common, conserved molecular structures found in groups of microbes (not present in host cells).
- Examples:
    - **Bacteria:** Lipopolysaccharide (LPS/endotoxin), lipoteichoic acid, flagellin (flagellar protein), unmethylated CpG DNA.
    - **Viruses:** Single-stranded or double-stranded RNA (**ssRNA**, **dsRNA**).

**Diagram Reference:**
![[image-9.png|661x390]]

**Table: PAMP Examples by Pathogen Type**

| Pathogen | Structural Components                  | Common PAMPs                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Viruses  | Envelope, Nucleocapsid, Nucleic acid   | ssRNA, dsRNA                                            |
| Bacteria | Capsule, Cell wall, Membrane, Flagella | LPS, lipoteichoic acid, flagellin, unmethylated CpG DNA |

- **COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Example:**
    - The innate immune system recognises viral nucleic acid (ssRNA, dsRNA) as foreign PAMPs.

### B. Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs)

**Key Concepts:**

- **PRRs** are specialised receptors on or inside innate immune cells (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells).
- **Toll-like receptors (TLRs):** Major family of PRRs that detect distinct PAMPs.
- Location:
    - Some PRRs are on cell surfaces (detect extracellular microbes)
    - Others are within phagosomes or endosomes (detect internalised microbial components)

**Functional Pathway:**

- When a PRR (like a TLR) binds a PAMP, it triggers a **signalling cascade** in the cell.
- Leads to changes in gene expression (**cell signalling to regulate gene transcription**), resulting in:
    - Production of inflammatory mediators
    - Recruitment of more immune cells
    - Activation of the adaptive immune response

## 7. Inflammation and Fever

### Definition and Mechanism of Fever

- **Fever (Pyrexia):**
    
    - Defined as **abnormally high body temperature (>37°C)**.
- **Mechanism:**
    
    - The **hypothalamus** resets the body’s “thermostat.”
    - Triggered by **pyrogens**: molecules released mainly by immune cells.
- **Key pathway:**
    
    - **Phagocytes** (especially macrophages) ingest bacteria → release pyrogenic **cytokines** (notably **interleukin-1 (IL-1)**).
    - IL-1 travels to the hypothalamus, initiating fever response.

### Adaptive Advantage of Fever

- **Why fever can help:**
    
    - Higher temperatures may inhibit some bacteria/virus growth.
    - Enhances immune cell activity (e.g., speeds up reactions or cell migration).
- **Important note:** _Excessively high fever can be dangerous and is regulated tightly._

## 6. Summary and Exam Tips

- **Know the key components of blood, especially the different leukocyte types, origins, and functions.**
- **Understand innate immune cell roles:** granulocytes (neutrophils, mast cells), monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells.
- **Phagocytic cell importance**: How monocytes become macrophages and their three essential immune functions.
- **PAMPs and PRRs:** Learn the main PAMPs for bacteria (LPS, flagellin, CpG DNA) and viruses (ssRNA, dsRNA), and how PRRs (like TLRs) recognise these patterns.
- **Fever mechanism and function:** IL-1 as a pyrogen, hypothalamic reset, and benefits (and risks) of fever.
- **Movement of immune cells:** From blood to tissues and via the lymphatic system.

**Pitfalls:**

- Confusing myeloid (innate) and lymphoid (adaptive) lineages.
- Assuming all immune cell types are equally phagocytic or found everywhere (e.g., mast cells are not in blood).
- Misidentifying PAMPs (e.g., LPS is not found on viruses; dsRNA is not found on bacteria).

**Tips/Connections:**

- Relate the location and movement of each immune cell type to its function (e.g., dendritic cells in tissue → activate adaptive immunity in lymph nodes).
- Focus on how innate detection (via PAMPs and PRRs) rapidly initiates defence and influences the adaptive response.
