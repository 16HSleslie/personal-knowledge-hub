B cells are a type of a lymphocyte central to the adaptive immune system. Antibody proteins produced by B cells are designed to bind specifically to antigens.

Explanation:
- **B cells** develop in *bone marrow* and express unique *antigen receptors (BCRs)*
- Upon activation, **B cells** differentiate into *plasma cells* (which secrete antibodies) and *memory B cells* (which provide long-term immunity).
- **B cells** are essential for the *humoral immune response*, targeting pathogens in body fluids.
