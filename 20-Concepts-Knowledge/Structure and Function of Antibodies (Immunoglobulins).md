**Basic antibody unit**: Composed of *2 identical heavy* chains and *2 light chains*
**Regions**:
- **Variable regions** - bind antigen (form the antigen-binding site)
- **Constant regions** - determine *antibody class* and *effector function*.
**Disulphide bridge** - hold chains together
**transmembrane region** - *anchors BCR* to the cell membrane (not present in secrete antibodies)

Explanation: 
- The variable regions at the tips of the antibody arms allow recognition of vast array of antigens
- The constant region mediates interaction with other immune components 

### Antigen Recognition
**Native antigen**: Antigen in it natural, unprocessed form
**Epitope**: Specific region on an antigen recognised by antibody.

Explanation:
- B cells must recognise and bind to almost any molecular structure via their BCRs
- Multiple antibodies can target different epitopes on the same pathogen
