- **Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs):** Cells (mainly dendritic cells) that process and present antigens to T cells.
- **CD4+ T cells (Helper T cells):** Recognize antigens on MHC-II; help activate B cells and other immune cells.
- **CD8+ T cells (Cytotoxic T cells):** Recognize antigens on MHC-I; kill infected or cancerous cells.

### Explanation
- Antigen presenting cells (APCs) - Cells (mainly dendritic cells) that process and present antigens to T cells
- CD4+ T cells - provide 'help' signals (cytokines) to B cells, promoting their differentiation into plasma cells that secrete antibodies
- CD8+ T cells - are activated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which induce apoptosis in infected cells via perforin and granzyme.
