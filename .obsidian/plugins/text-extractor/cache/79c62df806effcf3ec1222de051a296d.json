Objectives By the end of this lecture you should be able to: • describe the functions of the skeletal system • describe the gross structure of bones and explain how they reflect their functions • describe the different classes of bone in the human skeleton and explain how their shape relates to function • Identify the major bones of the skeleton, and understand why/how some are sexually dimorphic 2 Functions of the skeleton • Support • Movement • Bones are levers! • Protection • Major organs • Storage • Minerals • Red Blood Cell Formation • In marrow Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology (3rd Edition), 2018: pp 283 3 The Structure of Bones • There are 2 types of bone tissue (same material, different structure): • Compact Bone ➢ Strong ➢ Good at transmitting force in one direction • Cancellous (aka trabecular) bone ➢ Light, spongy bone ➢ Shock-absorbing ➢ Resists & channels forces that come from multiple directions Cancellous bone Cancellous bone Force from body weight/movement Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology (3rd Edition), 2018: pp 256 Compact bone 4 1. Long Bones • Longer than they are wide • Composed of wider epiphyses and a longer, narrower diaphysis • Act as levers for movement • Thicker compact bone in diaphysis • Mostly limb bones Bone Classes Proximal epiphysis Distal epiphysis Diaphysis Medullary cavity Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology (3rd Edition), 2018: pp 256 5 2. Short Bones • Close to equal width and length • Mostly cancellous bone • Weight bearing (from multiple directions) • E.g. Carpals and tarsals Bone Classes 6 3. Flat bones • Function usually for muscle attachment (e.g. scapula) • Also protection (e.g. skull, sternum) • Thin plates of compact bone (some cancellous too) Bone Classes Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology (3rd Edition), 2018: pp 311;419 7 4. Irregular bones • Doesn’t seem to fit into any other category? • Probably an irregular bone! • Various shapes and functions Bone Classes Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.304 Not long Not round/square shaped Not just cancellous bone Not flat Often have foramina (holes) 8 Divisions of the skeleton Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.253 Axial skeleton: • Bones of the core • Skull, sternum, ribs, vertebral column, sacrum, coccyx. • Protection of vital organs Appendicular skeleton: • Bones of the limbs • Most important for movement 9 The Skull ➢ Cranium (vault) - Encloses the brain - Muscle attachments ➢ Facial bones - Protect & support sensory organs ➢ Join at sutures (immovable) Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.284-5 Axial skeleton VAULT FACIAL 10 The Vertebral column • Keeps the trunk upright ➢ Lots of muscle/ligament attachments • Supports head • Divisions ➢ Cervical (7) ➢ Thoracic (12) ➢ Lumbar (5) ➢ Sacrum and coccyx Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.300 Axial skeleton 11Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.306-7 • Rib cage (thoracic cage) ➢ Ribs ➢ Sternum Axial skeleton Posterior articulation with thoracic vertebrae 12 Appendicular skeleton • Limbs • Regions ➢ Arm ➢ Forearm ➢ Thigh ➢ Leg Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.309 13 Limb structure • Single proximal long bone ➢ Humerus/Femur • Two distal long bones ➢ Ulna and Radius/ Tibia and Fibula - Ulna and radius more mobile • Hands and feet Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.253 14 Why is the human skeleton this shape? • FORM related to FUNCTION • We walk on 2 limbs (Bipedalism) vs. other apes on 4 limbs (Quadrapedalism) • Human lower limb needs STABILTY + MOVEMENT Anatomy Teaching Resources, University of Otago, 2018 15 Anatomy Teaching Resources, University of Otago, 2018 Hands free! • Not involved in locomotion • Lack of stability • Adapted for manipulation of environment/precision 16 Humerus and femur Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018 Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.288 • Humerus - shorter, lighter • Deeper articulation for prox. femur than prox. humerus • Stability vs. movement 17 Mobile forearms and wrists… Photograph from the Anatomy Resource Collection (2018). Clip Art used under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license from: http://sweetclipart.com • Pronation and supination of radius and ulna • Shape of distal articulation for wrist mobility Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.288 18 …vs. stability of legs • No pronation/supination. • Ankle joint = stable. • Tibia very robust (weight- bearing) MedialLateral 19 Hand ➢ Carpals (8) ➢ Metacarpals (5) ➢ Phalanges (14 - only 2 in the thumb) Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.288 20 Foot ➢ Tarsals (7) ➢ Metatarsals (5) ➢ Phalanges (14) Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.288 21 How do the limbs attach to the axial skeleton? • Pectoral (shoulder) girdle ➢ Clavicle ➢ Scapula • Pelvic girdle ➢ Hip bones (2) ➢ Sacrum (axial) Anatomy Teaching Resources, University of Otago, 2018 Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.310 Marieb & Hoehn, Human Anatomy & Physiology, 10th Edn, 2018 Wikicommons: Girdle (CC BY 3.0) 22 • Clavicle ➢ Stabilising • Scapula ➢ Free-moving, muscle attachments The pectoral girdle Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.310 23 Pelvic girdle Marieb & Hoehn, Human Anatomy & Physiology, 10th Edn, 2018• Hip bones (x2) ➢ Os coxae • Sacrum ➢ Part of the axial skeleton • Pelvic bones + sacrum = pelvis • Lots of weight bearing Palastanga et al, Anatomy and Human Movement, 1992 24Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.288 Close up on the pelvis 25 • WHY? • Pelvic cavity of biological females more circular • Pelvic outlet more open in biological females Anatomy Teaching Resources, University of Otago, 2018 Differences between biological male and female pelvic anatomy 26 Biological Female Biological Male Marieb & Hoehn, Human Anatomy & Physiology, 10th Edn, 2018 Subpubic angle Maximising space Different shape of pelvic cavity 27 • Check your Textbook (Martini et al. Visual Anatomy) chapter 7 • Check out this video from 2:40 – 3:45 for a summary of the types of bones https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDGqkM HPDqE Need some bones themed music for studying? Of course you do… https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3SpOxM6kkQQ2o9 aqPf5XBE?si=gw_7DoV6SK6eT5aadxlP9A I need to revise this stuff… 28 Test yourselves: What class of bone is a rib? A. Long B. Short C. Flat D. Irregular Why is cancellous bone good at shock absorbing? A. Because it has a structure that is all aligned in one direction B. Because it has a structure made of multi-directional struts C. Because it is very dense D. Because it contains lots of water What is the pectoral girdle? A. The bones that connect the upper limb to the axial skeleton B. The bones that connect the lower limb to the axial skeleton C. The humerus, scapula and clavicle D. The femur and hip bones Why do biologically male and female pelves have slightly different shapes? A. Biological males are stronger and bigger so their pelvis is always bigger B. Biological females do less physical activity C. The biologically male pelvis is adapted for muscle development. D. The biologically female pelvis is adapted for childbirth HUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
