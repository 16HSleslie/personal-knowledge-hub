Two kinds: 1. Apperceptive: cannot recognize facial expressions/cues 2. Associative: Cannot recognize an individual from their facial features 28 Ben Barres: Brilliant Neuroscientist, Champion for women in science 29 Example Aphasias: Wernicke’s: Individuals can produce words and even whole sentences, but the meaning is lost – create “word salad” Broca’s: Individuals can understand words, but cannot form the motor patterns to produce whole speech 30 Motor cortex Sensory cortex 31 Blindsight 1.
