By identifying shared characteristics, we can start to build a family tree of organisms. These family tress are called phylogenetic trees. Characteristics can be physical things or sequence information from biological molecules.
By doing this with a wide range of organisms, we can put all known life into 3 domains:
- Eukarya - Consists of kingdom plane, kingdom animalia, kingdom fungi, and protists.
- Bacteria - 1 of 2 prokaryotic domains, the most diverse and widespread prokaryotes which are classes into multiple kingdoms
- Archaea - 1 of 2 prokaryotic domains, many lie in earths extreme environments such as salty lakes and boiling hot springs
