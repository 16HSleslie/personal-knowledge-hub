HUBS 191 Jeff Erickson – Department of Physiology Lecture 19 Neurophysiology 2: Propagation and Synaptic Transmission Example exam question At the point indicated by the red arrow: A. the neuron is hyperpolarizing. B. voltage-gated Na+ channels have opened. C. the neuron is waiting for sufficient summation at the axon hillock. D. the rapid repolarization phase has begun. Changes in membrane potential during an action potential 2 Objectives and Study Guide After this lecture you should be able to: • Contrast the absolute and relative refractory periods of an action potential • Describe the movement of an action potential down the axon of a neuron • Describe the process of synaptic transmission at the axon terminal Related reading: Martini et al. Modules 9.6 (p. 366-67) and 11.11-11.14 (p. 464-470) 3 How does a chemical signal get converted into an electrical signal? • A chemical signal (neurotransmitter) binds to and opens chemically-gated ion channels. • Can be inhibitory or excitatory • Ions flow in or out, changing the voltage at a localized area of membrane. • Adding these ion movements together is called summation • If the membrane voltage reaches -60mV at the axon hillock… • The axon hillock contains lots of voltage-gated Na+ channels • …an electrical signal (action potential) begins. • Coordinated movement of ions leads to depolarization, repolarization, and hyperpolarization Electrical signal Chemical signal -60mV 4 How does an electrical signal (action potential propagation) trigger a chemical signal (neurotransmitter release)? Chemical signal (NT release) Action potential propagation • Na+ diffuses from the axon hillock to initiate an AP in the initial segment of the axon • AP propagates to each neighboring axon segment (unmyelinated axon) or node (myelinated axon) in one direction. • The AP arrives at the axon terminals, causing VG Ca2+ channels to open • Ca2+ enters terminals, causing release of neurotransmitter into synaptic cleft to activate the post-synaptic cell 5 Action potential propagation is the movement of the action potential down the axon to the terminal • During rapid depolarization, a ‘flood’ of Na+ enters the axon hillock • Na+ diffuses from the points of entry • We’ll ignore backwards diffusion…only diffusion down the axon towards the terminal matters for our purposes! Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.10 p. 462-3. 6 A refractory period is a period of rest after a stimulus during which another stimulus won’t have an effect Absolute refractory period • A 2nd AP cannot be generated • Occurs when VG Na+ channels are already open or become inactive. Relative refractory period • A 2nd AP can be generated only if the stimulus is much larger than normal. • Occurs when some VG Na+ channels begin to shift from an inactive to closed state. Note: VG Na+ channels cannot open when inactive. They only open from a closed state. Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.10 p. 462-3. 7 1. Stimulus = membrane depolarizes to threshold voltage (e.g. -60mV) 2. Channel changes shape (i.e opens) 3. Ions cross the membrane driven by their electrochemical gradient 4. Membrane potential changes will cause the channel to inactivate or close Voltage-gated ion channels open when they sense a (sufficiently large) change in voltage Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.8 p. 458. 8 Action potential cheat sheet ABSOLUTE Refractory Period RELATIVE Refractory Period Voltage-gated Na+ channels open, and sodium ions move into the cell. The membrane potential rises to about +30mV Voltage-gated (VG) Na+ channels inactivate, so Na+ stops entering cell. VG K+ channels open, and K+ exits cell. VG Na+ channels begin to shift to their closed state and can be opened only with a larger than normal stimulus. VG K+ channels begin to close but close slowly, which allows for excess exit of K+, thereby causing hyperpolarization. Summation (at the axon hillock) or diffusion of Na+ (along the axon) bring the membrane to threshold 9 Did you catch it? • What is a refractory period in neurons? • What is the difference between the absolute refractory period and the relative refractory period? • What is the state of voltage-gated Na+ channels in the absolute and relative refractory periods? DreamWorks Animation 10 Axon hillock Axon (in ‘segments’) In an unmyelinated axon, an influx of Na+ at the axon hillock leads to diffusion of Na+ into the initial segment, triggering depolarization Changes in membrane potential during an action potential Threshold Hyperpolarisation Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.11 p. 464. 11 Axon hillock Axon (in ‘segments’) Changes in membrane potential during an action potential Threshold Hyperpolarisation Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.11 p. 464. The Na+ continues to spread to segment 2, moving it from -70mV to -60mV (threshold) 12 Axon hillock Axon (in ‘segments’) Changes in membrane potential during an action potential Threshold Hyperpolarisation Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.11 p. 464. As we move past threshold, an action potential is triggered in segment 2. Back in the initial segment, VG Na+ channels are closing and VG K+ channels are opening…it’s time to repolarize! 13 Axon hillock Axon (in ‘segments’) Changes in membrane potential during an action potential Threshold Hyperpolarisation Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.11 p. 464. Segment 2 is rapidly depolarizing, and the movement of Na+ into the cell is now spreading to segment 3, which is nearing threshold. The initial segment is well on its way to hyperpolarization. 14 Unmyelinated vs Myelinated axons • Action potentials (APs) propagate along unmyelinated axons relatively slowly (e.g. ~ 1 to 5 meters per second - m/s) • Some axons can be ~1 m long (e.g. to lower limbs), so slow AP conduction is not adequate for all our needs. • Myelination dramatically increases AP conduction velocity • Ion movement is restricted to the areas without myelin (nodes), so conduction appears to jump from one node to the next. This is called saltatory conduction (from the Latin saltus: to leap) Myelin sheath: Schwann cells (PNS) or oligodendrocytes (CNS) wrap the axon in neighbouring segments Nodes (of Ranvier): narrow gaps with no myelin. High density of voltage- gated (VG) Na+ and K + channels. Wikipedia.org 15 Example exam question When a segment of a neuronal axon is undergoing rapid depolarization: A. Na+ is moving from inside to outside the neuron in that segment. B. that segment is in a relative refractory period. C. the next segment is about to move directly from its resting membrane potential to repolarization. D. that segment is in an absolute refractory period. 16 How does an electrical signal (action potential propagation) trigger a chemical signal (neurotransmitter release)? Chemical signal (NT release) Action potential propagation • Na+ diffuses from the axon hillock to initiate an AP in the initial segment of the axon • AP propagates to each neighboring axon segment (unmyelinated axon) or node (myelinated axon) in one direction. • The AP arrives at the axon terminals, causing VG Ca2+ channels to open • Ca2+ enters terminals, causing release of neurotransmitter into synaptic cleft to activate the post-synaptic cell 17 Key features of the chemical synapse Image credit: Chemical synapse.
