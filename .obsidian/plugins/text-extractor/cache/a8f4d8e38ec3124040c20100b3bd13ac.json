Ø catalytic in base Ø carbonyl activates C–H for deprotonation and is also the site of nucleophilic attack Ø pKa of aldehyde = 17, pKa of water = 15.7, so less than 10% of the aldehyde will be deprotonated to the enolate by hydroxide Ø acid catalysis possible H C CH3 O HO– 2 H C C H2 O C H OH CH3 acetaldehyde aldol pKa = 17 H2O pKa = 15.7 CHEM202 (2025) Constructing Carbon Frameworks – Lucas 3.13 Aldol Reaction Generally, aldol addition is the reaction between two molecules of an aldehyde or two molecules of a ketone. Ø 2 x aldehyde ➜ b-hydroxyaldehyde Ø 2 x ketone ➜ b-hydroxyketone The aldehyde/ketone must have an a-hydrogen.

Under forcing conditions, an aldol addition product may undergo dehydration/elimination of water (E1cb mechanism). This process is known as aldol condensation.

It can be obtained directly from the aldol reaction without isolating the intermediate b-hydroxy carbonyl compound.

Without some “control”, a mixture of products can be obtained ➜ not synthetically useful. With ketones, the situation may be even more complex: recall that unsymmetrical ketones can generate two possible enolates.

A single major crossed aldol reaction product may be obtained using an excess of an non-enolisable aldehyde and slowly adding a second aldehyde. The product can then undergo dehydration.
