But what does a 2D spectrum look like? 120 1D spectrum on x and y axis ‘Diagonal’ is the same peak on each axis ‘Cross-peaks’ appear off the diagonal, and only between coupling pairs No cross-peak when no coupling a cb bb (diagonal) cc (diagonal) aa (diagonal)ab crosspeak ab crosspeak COSY spectrum of 1-nitropropane. Notes: \"A\" shows that \"a\" is coupled to \"b\" and \"B\" shows that \"b\" is coupled to \"c.\" 121 COSY spectrum of 2-methyl-3-pentanone 122 This molecule has two discrete spin systems. A spin system is a group of protons connected (indirectly) by coupling. Iodobutane 123 All four signals are part of one spin system. Thus, we expect all signals to be (indirectly) connected through the COSY Iodobutane 124 All four signals are part of one spin system. Thus, we expect all signals to be (indirectly) connected through the COSY Predict the COSY for this molecule NOESY(Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) • Enables the molecular geometry to be defined • Effect (NOE) is transmitted through space (not bonds) between interacting nuclei • Interaction is based on relaxation processes following excitation of the nuclei • The NOE rapidly diminishes with distance (depends on d-6) • Nuclei must be relatively close together (d < 0.5 nm) • Refer Appendix 12; Advanced NMR techniques (Expt. 4) 125 A synthetic unknown, C13H10N2 - could be structure A or B? 126 A synthetic unknown, C13H10N2 - could be structure A or B? 127 Spin systems colourised. The difference in number of protons in each spin system will be diagnostic.

Use the number of signals expected in each set of spin systems to decide.
