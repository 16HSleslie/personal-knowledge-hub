Please note that although every effort is made to ensure this pre-lecture material corresponds to the live-lecture there may be differences / additions. 1 Human Body Systems (HUBS) 191 Terminology Dr Charlotte King Department of Anatomy © The content and delivery of all resources in this course are copyrighted.

Objectives By the end of this lecture you should be able to: • Explain the concept of homeostasis • Explain the ‘Anatomical Position’ • Define the terms used to describe spatial and positional relationships of structures • Define and demonstrate terms of movements as related to joints 2 Why is terminology important? • Effective communication • Avoids vague descriptions or directions • Look up words you don’t know the meaning of • Google the word + etymology (study of the origin of words) • For example: ➢ Homeostasis - homeo- the same - stasis- stopping, staying - Therefore ‘staying the same’ 3 Homeostasis • Underpins normal function of the systems of the human body • Maintain conditions in the internal environment • Homeostasis relies on regulatory mechanisms to ensure that controlled variables do not move too far from the set-point which is “normal\" ➢ Temperature ➢ Ion concentrations (calcium, potassium, sodium) ➢ Blood sugar levels ➢ Fluid balance ➢ …and many more 4 Homeostasis • Feedback ➢ When the controlled variable moves too far from the set point and responses from the body attempt to move the variable back to “normal” - E.g. If you get very cold, your body will reduce blood flow to the skin to reduce heat loss, and you might also start shivering to produce heat. • Feedforward ➢ Usually when there is an anticipation of an event that will alter a controlled variable, so you may do something to minimize the effect - You look outside and see it is snowing. You know that if you go outside in shorts and a t- shirt, your temperature will drop, so you dress in warm clothing before you go outside • You will explore these concepts further in HUBS 191 and 192 later! 5 Homeostasis Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.966 • Think about what happens when your body temperature rises • What does your body do to correct the temperature increase? • What behaviours do you consciously do to correct the temperature increase? • We will talk more about homeostasis in later modules, but for now, think about how the external environment affects your body, and what your response is. 6 Anatomical terminology • We use specific terminology to refer to: ➢ Body parts ➢ Directions ➢ Movements • Different to what you might say in casual conversation Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.80 • Upper Limb ➢ Arm ➢ Forearm ➢ Hand • Lower Limb ➢ Thigh ➢ Leg ➢ Foot 7 Anatomical position • Upright • Face forwards • Feet together • Palms face forwards • Remains the same regardless of movement Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.80Why do you think this is important? 8 We use these to describe body parts in relation to other parts • Anterior • Posterior Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.82 Terms of direction 9 Terms of direction We use these to describe body parts in relation to other parts • Superior • Inferior • Medial • Lateral • Proximal • Distal Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.82 1011 S uperficialSupe r f i c ialSuperficial Deep e.g. bone is deep to muscle e.g. skin is superficial to muscle Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.436 12 • Deep – further from the surface • Superficial – closer to the surface Division of body- planes Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.83 Coronal Sagittal Transverse 13 • Sagittal ➢ divides the body into left and right pieces ➢ Midsagittal or median plane - divides body into mirror image left and right halves Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.83 14 • Sagittal Gosling et al, Atlas of Human Anatomy, 1985Anatomy Teaching Resources, University of Otago, 2018 15Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.83 • Coronal ➢ divides the body into front and back sections 16 Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.83 Gosling et al, Atlas of Human Anatomy, 1985 Netter, Atlas of Human Anatomy, 2004 • Transverse ➢ divides the body into top and bottom sections 17 Planes, summarized: Coronal Sagittal Transverse 18 Movement Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018 19 Movement occurs in planes • Sagittal ➢ back and forward movements • Coronal ➢ side to side movements • Transverse ➢ rotating movements 20Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.83 Angular movements • Flexion ➢ Decreases angle ➢ Fleshy parts of limb brought closer together 21 Movement in the sagittal plane: Flexion/extension Extension • Increases angle Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.83 22 Dorsiflexion ➢ Toes brought up towards face Plantarflexion ➢ Toes pointing towards ground Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.83 23 Foot movement in the sagittal plane: Abduction ➢ Movement at joint moves limb away from midline Adduction ➢ Movement at joint moves limb towards midline Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.83 24 Movement in the coronal plane: Anatomy Teaching Resources, University of Otago, 2019 25 Inversion ➢ Sole of foot faces towards midline Eversion ➢ Sole of foot turns away from midline Marieb & Hoehn, Human Anatomy & Physiology, 10th Edn, 2018 26 Foot movement in the coronal plane: 27 A less obvious example of abduction… Circumduction ➢ Combination of four movements ➢ Flexion/abduction/extension/adduction ➢ NO rotation Anatomy Teaching Resources, University of Otago, 2011 Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.83 28 Rotation • Rotation around the long axis of a joint Saladin, Anatomy & Physiology, 4th Edn, 2007 Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.83 29 Rotation • Lateral (external) • Medial (internal) Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.83 Saladin, Anatomy & Physiology, 4th Edn, 2007 30 Specialised movements Pronation ➢ Palm faces posterior Supination ➢ Palm faces anterior and forearm bones parallel Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.83 31 Some homework: • Practice using these new terminologies ➢ Get into the habit of using scientific names for body parts/regions • Practice the movements • Write your own questions to test knowledge e.g. ➢ The arm is _____ to the hand a) Superior b) Distal c) Proximal d) Lateral 32 Summary: • Main concepts: ➢ Homeostasis is the maintenance of “normal” set points of bodily functions - You will explore examples of these in later HUBS 191 lectures and laboratories ➢ The anatomical position is a defined reference point for anatomy ➢ The body can be sectioned in different planes ➢ Description of anatomical location is usually in relation to another structure for reference - i.e. nose is superior to chin; thumb is lateral to index finger ➢ Movement of the body is defined by specific terminology - You will explore these terms in more detail in Laboratories 1 and 2 33 HUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
