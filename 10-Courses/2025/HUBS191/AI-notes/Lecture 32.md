## 1. Overview of Immune Defence Layers

**Key Concepts:**

- **Physical & Chemical Barriers:** First line of defence (e.g., skin, mucosal membranes).
- **Innate Immune System:** Rapid, non-specific response to pathogens.
- **Adaptive Immune System:** Slower, highly specific response with memory.

**Explanation:**

- The immune system is organized into three main layers:
    - **Barriers** prevent pathogen entry.
    - **Innate immunity** responds quickly to a wide range of invaders.
    - **Adaptive immunity** targets specific pathogens and provides long-term protection.

## 2. The Inflammatory Response

**Key Concepts:**

- **Inflammation:** A localized tissue response to injury or infection, recruiting immune cells to the site.

**Explanation:**

- Triggered by tissue damage or infection.
- **Tissue-resident cells** (e.g., mast cells, macrophages) release **chemical signals** (cytokines, chemokines).
- These signals:
    - Attract immune cells (especially neutrophils).
    - Cause **vasodilation** (widening of blood vessels).
    - Increase **capillary permeability** (making vessels “leaky”).
- **Neutrophils**:
    - Enter blood from bone marrow.
    - Adhere to capillary walls near the injury.
    - Squeeze through vessel walls (extravasation) following chemical gradients to the site.

**Key Visuals or Data:**

- _Summary_: Illustrates the stepwise recruitment of neutrophils from blood to the site of injury, guided by chemical signals and changes in blood vessel properties.

## 3. Phagocytosis: Mechanism and Importance

**Key Concepts:**

- **Phagocytosis:** The process by which certain immune cells ingest and destroy microbes or debris.
- **Phagocytes:** Cells capable of phagocytosis (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages).

**Explanation:**

- Discovered by Elie Metchnikoff (1886-87).
- **Phagocytosis** involves several steps:
    1. **Adherence:** Phagocyte binds to pathogen or debris.
    2. **Engulfment:** Phagocyte extends pseudopods, surrounding the target and forming a **phagosome**.
    3. **Fusion:** **Lysosome** fuses with the phagosome, forming a **phagolysosome**.
    4. **Digestion:** Pathogen is destroyed by toxic compounds and enzymes.
    5. **Exocytosis:** Indigestible material is expelled.

**Key Visuals or Data:**

- _Summary_: Diagram shows the sequential steps of phagocytosis, highlighting the role of lysosomes and enzymes.

- _Summary_: Micrograph demonstrates neutrophils actively engulfing bacteria, a real-world example of phagocytosis.

## 4. Killing and Digestion of Microbes

**Key Concepts:**

- **Phagolysosome:** The vesicle where ingested microbes are killed and digested.

**Explanation:**

- Microbes are destroyed inside phagolysosomes by:
    - **Low pH:** Acidic environment denatures proteins.
    - **Reactive oxygen intermediates:** e.g., hydrogen peroxide.
    - **Reactive nitrogen intermediates:** e.g., nitric oxide.
    - **Enzymes:** Proteases (break down proteins), lipases (break down fats), nucleases (break down nucleic acids).

**Example:**

- After engulfment, a neutrophil uses these mechanisms to kill bacteria like _Staphylococcus aureus_.

## 5. The Complement System

**Key Concepts:**

- **Complement:** A group of 9 major proteins (C1–C9) that act in a cascade to clear pathogens.

**Explanation:**

- Complement proteins circulate in the blood in an inactive form.
- When activated, they trigger a cascade of reactions, amplifying the immune response.
- The cascade can be initiated by three main pathways.

**Key Visuals or Data:**

- ![Waterfall metaphor for complement cascade](No image URL available)
- _Summary_: The waterfall image represents the sequential, amplifying nature of the complement cascade.

## 6. Complement Pathways and Outcomes

### Complement Activation Pathways

**Key Concepts:**

- **Classical Pathway:** Triggered by antibodies bound to pathogens.
- **Alternative Pathway:** Triggered by direct binding of complement to pathogen surfaces.
- **Lectin Pathway:** Triggered by microbial carbohydrates binding to complement.

**Key Visuals or Data:**

- ![Three complement pathways: Classical, Alternative, Lectin](No image URL available)
- _Summary_: Diagram shows the three distinct initiation routes for complement activation.

### Convergence and Amplification

- All pathways lead to the formation of **C3 convertase** (an enzyme complex).
- **C3 convertase** amplifies the response and leads to three main outcomes.

**Key Visuals or Data:**

- ![Flowchart: Pathways → C3 convertase → Outcomes](No image URL available)
- _Summary_: Visualizes how different triggers converge on a common amplification step, leading to effector functions.

### Three Main Outcomes of Complement Activation

1. **Label (Opsonisation)**
    
    - **Opsonisation:** Coating of microbes with **antibody** and/or **C3b** (a complement fragment).
    - Enhances recognition and ingestion by phagocytes.
    - ![Opsonized bacteria being engulfed by macrophage](No image URL available)
    - _Summary_: Opsonins act as “tags” for phagocytes, making pathogens easier to ingest.
2. **Recruit**
    
    - **C3a and C5a** (complement fragments) act as chemoattractants.
    - Attract phagocytes to the site of infection.
    - Induce **mast cell degranulation**, releasing inflammatory mediators.
    - ![Mast cell degranulation diagram](No image URL available)
    - _Summary_: Shows how complement fragments recruit immune cells and amplify inflammation.
3. **Destroy**
    
    - **Membrane Attack Complex (MAC):** Formed by C5b, C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9 molecules.
    - Inserts into pathogen membranes, forming pores and causing lysis.
    - ![MAC pore formation in target cell membrane](No image URL available)
    - _Summary_: MAC physically disrupts microbial membranes, leading to cell death.

**Key Terms and Formulas:**

- **C3 convertase:** Central enzyme complex in complement activation.
- **Opsonisation:** Enhancement of phagocytosis by marking pathogens.
- **MAC (Membrane Attack Complex):** Structure that lyses target cells.

## 7. Summary and Exam Tips

- **Inflammation** is a rapid, localized response that recruits immune cells to sites of injury or infection.
- **Phagocytosis** is a multi-step process involving adherence, engulfment, digestion, and exocytosis.
- **Killing of microbes** inside phagocytes relies on low pH, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, and digestive enzymes.
- **Complement system** can be activated by three pathways (classical, alternative, lectin), all converging on C3 convertase.
- **Three main outcomes of complement activation:** Label (opsonisation), Recruit (inflammation), Destroy (lysis via MAC).
- **Key terms to remember:** Opsonisation, C3 convertase, MAC, phagolysosome.
- **Common pitfalls:** Confusing the roles of complement fragments (C3b = opsonisation, C3a/C5a = recruitment/inflammation, C9 = MAC/lysis).
- **Exam tip:** Be able to describe the sequence and purpose of each step in inflammation, phagocytosis, and complement activation. Use diagrams to reinforce your explanations.

**Clarification Note:** If asked about the main mechanism for killing phagocytosed microbes, the correct answer is **reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates** (not just enzymes or receptor binding).
