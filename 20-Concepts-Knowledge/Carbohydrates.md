A carbohydrates is a biomolecule composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. There are 4 levels of carbohydrates:
- Monosaccharides (simple carbohydrates or sugars)
- Disaccharides (simple carbohydrates or sugars)
- Oligosaccharides (complex carbohydrates)
- Polysaccharides (complex carbohydrates)

Functions of carbohydrates include:
- Recognition
- Energy - sugars are stored for later use in the form of storage polysaccharides (such as starch or glycogen)
- Structure - structural polysaccharides can provide structural support (such as cellulose in plant cell walls)
