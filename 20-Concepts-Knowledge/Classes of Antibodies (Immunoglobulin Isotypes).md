The five classes of antibodies are: *IgG*, *IgA*, *IgM*, *IgE*, *IgD*
Each class has unique structure, distribution, and function.

### IgG
**Structure**: Monomer
**Distribution**: Most abundant in blood
**Functions**:
- *Opsonization*
- *Neutralisation*
- *Crosses placenta* (provides passive immunity to fetus)
**Targets**: Viruses, bacteria

### IgA
**Structure**: Dimer (with J chain and secretory component in secretions); monomer in blood
**Distribution**: Secretions (tears, saliva, mucus, breast milk)
**Functions**:
- *Defence of mucous membrane* (especially gut)
- *Passive immunity* to infant in breast milk
**Targets**: Viruses, bacteria

### IgM
**Structure**: Pentamer (with J chain)
**Distribution**: First antibody produced in response to infection; expressed on naïve B cells as BCR
**Functions**:
- *Activates complement* very effectively
- *Targets extracellular bacteria*
- *Acts on BCR* on naïve B cells


### IgE
**Structure**: Monomer
**Distribution**: Low concentration in blood
**Functions**:
- *Immunity to multicellular parasites*
- *Allergic reaction* (activates mast cells)
**Notes**: Responsible for symptoms of allergies (e.g. to pollen, penicillin)

### IgD
**Structure**: Monomer
**Distribution**: Expressed on naïve B cells
**Functions**: 
- *Acts as BCR* (with IgM)
**Notes**: Specific function is not well under
