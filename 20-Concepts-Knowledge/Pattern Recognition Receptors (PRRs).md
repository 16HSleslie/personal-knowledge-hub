Pattern recognition receptors are specialised receptors on or inside innate immune cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells).
**Toll-like receptors** are a major family of PPRs that detect distinct PAMPs

Location;
- some PPRs are on cell surfaces (detect extracellular microbes)
- Others are within phagosomes or endosomes (detect internal microbes)

Functional pathway:
When a PPR binds to PAMP, it triggers a signalling cascade in the cells. This leads to changes in gene expression (cell signalling to regulate gene expression), resulting in:
- Production of inflammatory mediators
- Recruitment of more immune cells
- Activation of adaptive immune response
