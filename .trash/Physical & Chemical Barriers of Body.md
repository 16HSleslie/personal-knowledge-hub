Skins defence
- Phagocytic immune cells which reside in both the epidermis & dermis
- Antimicrobial peptides called defensins
- Lysosomes - enzyme which breaks down bacteria wall
- Sebum - from sebaceous glands, has low pH which prevents microbial colonisation
- Salt - from sweat glands, creates hypertonic environment which dehydrates microbes

Mucous Membrane Defence
- Respiratory membranes have a Mucociliary escalator (made of dine hairs called cilia) which clear mucous
- GI tract has low pH, bile & digestive enzymes
- eyes have tears containing lysozyme
- Urogenital tract has urine flow, lysozyme, low pH and high osmolarity
