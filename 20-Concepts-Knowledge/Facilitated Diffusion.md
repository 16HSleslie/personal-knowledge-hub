Facilitated diffusion allows the movement of hydrophilic molecules across membranes. This requires membrane proteins called channels and carriers. Still, no energy is required because these substances are moving down their concentration gradient, but they need to be aided because they are hydrophilic substances. The channel proteins may open or close in response to some signals, and carrier undergo a shape change to help guide the molecule.
