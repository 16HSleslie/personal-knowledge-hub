HUBS 191 Jeff Erickson – Department of Physiology Lecture 9 Skeletal Muscle: Contraction, Tension, and Fibre Types Example exam question Which of the following events during EC-coupling would contribute to relaxation of a muscle cell? A. A signal arrives at the cell through the t-tubules. B. The SERCA pump moves calcium into the SR. C. The voltage-gated channel (DHPR) is activated. D. The ryanodine receptor (RyR) releases calcium from the SR. 2 Objectives and Study Guide After this lecture you should be able to: • Describe the sequence of events that occur during a cross-bridge cycle • Explain the two determinants of skeletal muscle force generation • Describe the key differences between fast and slow muscle fibres Related reading: Martini et al. Modules 9.7 (p. 368-69), 9.10 (p. 374- 75), and 9.14 (p. 382-83) 3 The myofilament is primarily composed of actin and myosin Martini et al., Visual Anatomy and Physiology (3rd ed), Module 9.3, pg 360. Actin Myosin 4 Actin forms the thin filament, a structural scaffold that runs along the myofilament dreamstime.comActin filament In this example, the rope is like the actin filament… 5 Myosin forms the thick filament and acts a motor molecule, attaching to actin and generating force to pull dreamstime.com Myosin filament …and the people are like the myosin, complete with hands that act like myosin heads! Individual myosin Myosin head 6 Actin and myosin bind together when calcium is present, forming cross-bridges and allowing contraction to occur Martini et al., Visual Anatomy and Physiology (3rd ed), Module 9.8, pg 371. 7 The myofilament has just finished a power stroke (pulling on actin). Actin/myosin cross-bridges are still present. Cross-Bridge Cycling Boron, W. F., & Boulpaep, E. L. (2009). Medical physiology (2nd ed). 8 A molecule of ATP binds to the myosin, in preparation for releasing some energy to prime the myosin head. The binding of ATP causes the myosin head to release actin…no more cross- bridge! Cross-Bridge Cycling Boron, W. F., & Boulpaep, E. L. (2009). Medical physiology (2nd ed). 9 The myosin head burns the ATP to make energy (and some ADP waste). It stores the energy by changing the shape of the myosin, getting it ready to pull on actin again. Cross-Bridge Cycling Boron, W. F., & Boulpaep, E. L. (2009). Medical physiology (2nd ed). 10 If calcium is present and bound to the myofilament, then it’s time for the next contraction! The energized myosin head can now bind to actin, forming a cross-bridge. Cross-Bridge Cycling Boron, W. F., & Boulpaep, E. L. (2009). Medical physiology (2nd ed). 11 We now have a cross-bridge with an energized myosin head attached to actin. The myosin uses its stored energy to pull, causing the actin filament to slide. The sarcomere shortens…contraction has occurred! Cross-Bridge Cycling Boron, W. F., & Boulpaep, E. L. (2009). Medical physiology (2nd ed). 12 Did you catch it? • What are the two key proteins that make up the myofilament? • What is the order of the five states within the cross-bridge cycle? At what point in the cross-bridge cycle does the myofilament slide? • What event has to happen for a cross-bridge to form? What event has to happen for the cross-bridge to be released? NZ Herald 13 Example exam question If calcium is present in a muscle cell and myosin binds to the actin filament, which of the following events would typically occur NEXT? A. The myosin head goes through a power stroke, pulling on the actin filament. B. ATP binds to the myosin head. C. ATP is converted into ADP, energizing the myosin head. D. The myosin head detaches from actin. 14 Muscle Tension 2. The rate at which the muscle is stimulated 1. The number of muscle fibres recruited Tension (or force) depends on two things: P375 15 • The number of fibres activated is regulated by how many neurons are active at one time. • A small number of active neurons tends to produce low force from the muscle, with the amount of force generally increasing as more neurons are activated. • This process of activating more fibres to make more force is called recruitment. Muscle Tension – Recruitment Martini et al., Visual Anatomy and Physiology (3rd ed), Module 9.10, pg 375. 16 Muscle Tension – Frequency of stimulation • A SINGLE action potential will result in a pulse of Ca2+ release into the cytoplasm, and a short period of tension development, called a twitch. • Many action potentials fired in rapid sequence results in a sustained release of Ca2+ from the SR, a sustained period of actin-myosin interaction, and a sustained period of contraction (summation). • Eventually we reach maximal signaling and contraction capability of the muscle, at which point the force will plateau. This is called tetanus. Sherwood, Lauralee. (2013). Human physiology : from cells to systems. Belmont, CA :Brooks/Cole 17 Actin and myosin bind together when calcium is present, forming cross-bridges and allowing contraction to occur Martini et al., Visual Anatomy and Physiology (3rd ed), Module 9.8, pg 371. 18 Length-Tension Relationship • Each muscle has an optimal length where it will be strongest, and when either longer or shorter than that length, it will be weaker • This is a result of the changing overlap between the actin and myosin filaments • Not enough overlap and you don’t get many cross-bridges…too much and there’s no space left to contract! 19 Think about how we make use of the length-tension principle when designing human-powered machines, such as bicycles. Why can you ride faster on a bike that is the “right size”? https://velo-orange.blogspot.com/2010/06/that-frame- doesnt-fit.html https://www.thesoleclinic.com/blogs/bike-fitting- myths/ 20 Muscle fibre types: Fast fibres vs. Slow fibres clipart-library.com Martini et al., Visual Anatomy and Physiology (3rd ed), Module 9.14, pg 382. Fast fibres are mighty but fatigue quickly, while slow fibres supply steady force and are slow to tire clipart-library.com Martini et al., Visual Anatomy and Physiology (3rd ed), Module 9.14, pg 382. Colour Fibre diameter Large Small Capillary supply Few Many Mitochondria supply Few Many Time to peak tension White Red Fatigue resistance Low High Fast! Slow… Summary • The myofilament proteins actin and myosin bind together when cellular calcium is high, creating cross-bridges. Myosin then uses the energy liberated from ATP to pull on the actin filament, causing a contraction. • Skeletal muscle force generation depends on the number of fibres that contract (recruitment) and the frequency of stimulation, up to a maximum possible force (tetanus). • Muscles rich in fast fibres produce lots of force quickly thanks to their energy reserves, but they tire out quickly too! Slow fibres are able to generate a lot of energy even while working, so they are difficult to fatigue.
