Objectives • Know that DC take up antigen and stimulate T cells in lymph node or spleen. • Understand how DC use MHC-I & MHC-II to stimulate CD8 and CD4 T cells. • Know how T cells develop (born in bone marrow → TCR rearrangement in the thymus) and form effector and memory cells. • Understand that CD4 helper cells help both CD8 T cells and B cells (next lecture) responses. • Pre-reading: Marieb; p802-806, 811-819 23 Infection and inflammation of tissue e.g. skin Lymph node *Dendritic cells T cell and B cell activation *Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen presenting cell Antibodies Helper / Cytotoxic T cells 4 Peptides: loaded onto MHC class I molecules for immune surveillance Cytoplasmic antigen e.g. virus Endogenous antigens Destruction MHC-I CD8 T cell proteasome Viral Proteins 3 Viral protein translation peptides Virus infection The ‘proteasome’ degrades proteins to peptides. 56 MHC-I antigen processing • Antigenic proteins are degraded to peptides (in the cytoplasm) by the proteasome. • Peptide loading of MHC-I takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 7 Peptide: loaded onto MHC class II molecules for immune surveillance Destruction Phagolysosome Phagocytosis of exogenous antigens e.g. bacteria, virus, fungi. Exogenous antigens MHC-II 8 MHC-II antigen processing • Antigenic proteins are degraded in acidic phagolysosome. • Peptide loading of MHC-II takes place in phagolysosome. 9 T cells DC 10 CD8 TCR MHC-I peptide APC CTL apoptosis Perforin / granzyme Vaccines / pathogens Virus- infected cell B cell Antibody production TCR MHC-II CD4peptide CD4 ‘Help’ ‘Help’ CD8 Plasma cell Native antigen MHC-I / Peptide TCR 11 T cells • Are lymphocytes that arise in the bone marrow and fully develop in thymus • T cells express T cell receptor (TCR) with co-receptors (either CD4 or CD8). • Recognise MHC / peptide complexes. 12 Blood Thymus Bone marrow T cell development / TCR gene rearrangement Production of T cell precursors lymphoid organs, blood & tissues. 13 T cells develop in the thymus 14 TCR gene rearrangement in thymus Mature (naïve) T cells expressing unique antigen receptors (TCR) T cells express a unique T cell receptor Immature T cells (TCR genes in germline state) in bone marrow 15 Thymic gene rearrangement • Immature T cells (thymocytes) rearrange the ‘variable’ parts of their TCR genes in the thymus • The rearrangement process is essentially random. • This ensures that individual T cells are unique in terms of their TCR. Creates ‘diversity’ in T cell repertoire. 16 T cells express a T cell receptor (TCR) that recognises peptide + MHC TCR APC (e.g. Dendritic Cell) MHC peptide T cell Variable region of TCR 17 CD4 and CD8 ‘co-receptors’ on T cells CD8 CD4 TCR CD4 TCR CD8 18 CD4 and CD8 expression on T cells TCR CD4 TCR CD8 MHC-I / peptide APC APC MHC-II / peptide CD4 and CD8 molecules assist with the docking of the TCR onto MHC-II or MHC-I respectively T cell differentiation • T cells that have not been activated by MHC / peptide are ‘naïve’. • Activated T cells are also known as ‘effector T cells’. 1920 CD4 T helper cell • Recognises MHC-II / peptide • Helps CD8 T cell become cytotoxic • Helps B cell make antibody 21 CD8 T cell • Recognise MHC-I / peptide • Develops into ‘cytotoxic T lymphocyte’ (CTL) aka ‘cytotoxic T cell’. 22 CD8+APC Vaccines / pathogens TCR MHC-I peptide CD8 CD4+ cytokines Cytokines produced by CD4 T cells help CD8 T cells become activated 23 Cell death (apoptosis) CTL Virally-infected cell KillsViral Peptide TCR MHC-I Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes 24 Adaptive defenses Humoral immunity Cellular immunity Helper T cells help in humoral immunity Helper T cells help in cellular immunity Helper T cell T cell receptor (TCR) Helper T cell CD4 protein MHC II protein of B cell displaying processed antigen IL-4 and other cytokines B cell (being activated) CD8 T cell (becomes TC cell after activation) Class I MHC protein CD8 protein APC (dendritic cell) Class II MHC protein CD4 protein Helper T cell IL-2 1 2 1 2 3 TH cell binds with the self-nonself complexes of a B cell that has encountered its antigen and is displaying it on MHC II on its surface. TH cell releases interleukins as co- stimulatory signals to complete B cell activation. TH cell binds dendritic cell. TH cell stimulates dendritic cell to express co-stimulatory molecules. Dendritic cell can now activate CD8 cell with the help of interleukin 2 secreted by TH cell. Marieb p816 25 Memory T cells In addition to the formation of ‘effector’ cells, T cell activation results in the formation of memory T cells Memory CD4 or CD8 T cells reside in the body for long periods of time. Memory T cells become effector cells much quicker than naïve T cells. Summary • Dendritic cells (DC) stimulate T cells using MHC-peptide. Occurs in lymph node and spleen • T cells express unique T cell receptors (TCR) and develop into mature T cells in the thymus • CD4 T cells are helper cells that respond to MHC-II- peptide. • CD8 T cells respond to MHC-I-peptide and become cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). • T cells form memory cells. 26 The T cell receptor of CD4 T cells recognises: A) The CD8 co-receptor on CD8 T cells. B) MHC-I / peptide complexes on antigen presenting cells. C) MHC-II / peptide complexes on antigen presenting cells. D) Native antigen on MHC-II 2728 The T cell receptor of CD8 T cells recognises: A) MHC-I / peptide complexes on antigen presenting cells (e.g. dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells). B) MHC-I / peptide complexes on virus-infected or cancer cells. C) MHC-II / peptide complexes on antigen presenting cells. D) Both (A) and (B) are correct. 29 The following is true for presentation of viral antigens: A) Viral antigens are exclusively presented on MHC-I B) Viral antigens are mostly presented on MHC-I, but can also be presented on MHC-II by APC (e.g. DC) C) Viral antigens are mostly presented on MHC-II D) Viral antigens are mostly presented on MHC-II, but can be presented on MHC-I by DC 30 T cells express a diverse range of T cell receptors (TCR) due to: A) Somatic hypermutation B) Expression of germline sequences from both chromosomes C) Expression of rearranged TCR genes D) Clonal selection E) Thymic selection 31 The site of T cell germline TCR gene rearrangement is the: A) Thyroid gland B) Pancreas C) Thymus D) Spleen E) Bone marrow 32 Immature T cell-precursors (‘baby T cells’) arise in the: A) Thyroid gland B) Pancreas C) Thymus D) Spleen E) Bone marrow 33 Antigen presenting cells include: A) neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils & basophils B) T cells and B cells C) Natural killer cells, monocytes & macrophages D) B cells, macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells 34 Lymphocytes that have not seen antigen are termed: A) guileless B) jejune C) provincial D) callow E) naïve 35 Following stimulation via MHC-I, CD8 T cells become: A) natural killer cells B) apoptotic cells C) plasma cells D) Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (aka cytotoxic T cells) 36 Long-lived T cells (or B cells) that respond vigorously to a second encounter of antigen are: A)Recollection cells B) Effector cells C) Memory cells D) Thymocytes E) Medullary cells 37 CD8+APC CTL apoptosis Kills Vaccines / pathogens Virus- infected cell B cell CD4+ ‘Help’ ‘Help’ Plasma cell Next lecture: B cells and antibody HUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
