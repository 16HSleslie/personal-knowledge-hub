Remember coupling is reciprocal: if A splits B by x Hz, then B also splits A by x Hz. • The relative intensities of the multiplets, which are symmetrical about their midpoints, are given by Pascal’s triangle. Coupling cont. 8081 For clearly resolved split signals, chemical shift is measured at the midpoint of the split structure (gray arrows) 82 Coupling arises because neighbouring nuclides are in varying spin states Remember the 2I+1 rule stating the number of spin states a nucleus has Nuclei ‘see’ neighbouring nuclei in these varying spin states Remember the populations of these spin states, even in the presence of a strong magnetic field, is roughly equal (ppm differences) ‘Seeing’ these nuclei in one or the other spin state results in slightly different resonant frequencies. The difference in frequency is the coupling constant (J). Coupling is not observed between magnetically equivalent nuclei. This ‘seeing’ or communication is a through-bond-interaction and typically only observed to nuclei 3 or fewer bonds away. Splitting thus provides information on the connectivity of the nuclei causing the signals in the NMR Coupling in a nutshell 83 Simple examples • If a there is one neighbour, with two possible spin states, two signals (a 1:1 doublet) will be observed. (shown) • If there is one neighbour with 3 possible spin states, a 1:1:1 triplet will be observed. (not shown!) • If there are threeneighbours, each with two possible spin states, four different configurations of the neighbours are possible, and four signals will be observed in a 1:3:3:1 ratio (shown) • Hence by observing the multiplicity ncan be determined. Remember coupling is reciprocal: if A splits B by x Hz, then B also splits A by x Hz. • The relative intensities of the multiplets, which are symmetrical about their midpoints, are given by Pascal’s triangle. Coupling cont. 84 For very simple compounds we do see these “text book” multiplets. Coupling cont. However, for most compounds this is an over simplification as the magnitude of coupling is influenced by geometryand the rangeof the interaction. This leads to more complex splitting patterns. Coupling range • geminalthrough twobonds (H’s attached to same atom) • vicinalthrough threebonds (H’s attached to adjacent atoms) • long-rangethrough greater than three bonds 85 Spin Systems The analysis of connectivity in complex molecules can be simplified by identifying spin systems, that is substructures within a molecule through which coupling extends. Nomenclature of spin systems A different letter is used to describe each different proton environments (ie different chemical shift) within a spin system. Each letter represents a set. i) Protons separated by a small chemical shift difference (of the same order as the coupling between the relevant nuclei ie J in Hz ~ in Hz) are designated by the letters A, B. C ii) Protons separated by a large chemical shift difference (/ J > 7) are designated by the letters A..., X... Eg for three well-separated chemical shifts the letters A... M..., X are used iii) The number of protons in each set is designated by a subscript number 8687 1st Order Analysis If / J > 7 then and J can values can be directly read from the spectrum • > J nuclei are said to be weakly coupled eg AX • ~ J nuclei are said to be strongly coupled eg AB • all first order spectra, nuclei are weakly coupled 88 Strongly coupled systems In this case the mid-points of multiplets no longer reflect the true and the line intensities may be distorted Analysis is usually more complicated, but some systems are easily recognised eg the AB system •Two strongly coupled nuclei, AB system (A-B = JAB) • Observe a 4-line pattern • symmetrical about the midpoint • No longer 1:1 doublets! 89 Non 1st Order Analysis cont. •Chemical shifts, Aand B, are ‘the centre of gravity’ of each doublet. To calculate the true of each we need to know the absorption frequencies (, in Hz) JAB = 2-1 = 4-3 midpoint = (A+ B) / 2 [= (2+ 3) /2 or (1+ 4) /2 ] B-A = [(4-1)(3-2)]1/2 Intensity ratio I2/I1= I3/I4 = (4-1)/(3-2) 90 Magnitude of Coupling Constants 91 Coupling notation Magnitude of Coupling Constants 92 What determines the magnitude of J? a) Geminal • hybridisation (see table of J values) • the presence of EWGs • addition of EWGs to the carbon causes a decrease in the observed J H H RO R H H RO RO H HR R Observed J value (Hz)12.5 10.5 6.0 93 b) Vicinal Coupling Three major influences in saturated systems • substituent effects - electronegative groups  J  •bond lengths - an increase in C-C bond length  J  •dihedral angle () - huge impact on J, yields useful conformational information 94 Karplus Relationship (vicinal, 3J) • describes relationship between and J 95 Magnitude of Coupling Constants 9697 c) Long range spin-spin coupling • commonly observed over 4 or 5 bonds eg aromatic systems, see Table of J values • J values are typically small (0-3 Hz). Small J-values may be manifested as line broadening. 98","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
