Lipids are the only type of macromolecule that are not polymers. A key trait of lipids is that they are hydrophobic, meaning they mix poorly with water, due to their molecular structure. They include molecules such as:
- Triacylglycerols
- Steroids
- Phospholipids
- Glycolipids
- Fat-soluble vitamins

Lipids carry out structural functions, such as cholesterol and phospholipids in cell membranes. They also have a regulatory role, and are able store energy.
