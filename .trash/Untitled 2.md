## 1. Blood and the Immune System

### Brief Overview of Blood Components

- **Blood** is composed of:
    - **Plasma** (~55%): Contains proteins (including **antibodies/immunoglobulin**), other solutes, and water.
    - **Formed elements** (~45%): Includes platelets, **white blood cells (leukocytes)**, and red blood cells.

**Key Visual:**

- _Summary_: This diagram illustrates the separation of blood into plasma and cellular elements, emphasising the compartmentalisation and functions relating to immunity.

**Table: Composition of Whole Blood**

|Component|Percentage|Constituents|
|---|---|---|
|Plasma|55%|Proteins (including antibodies), other solutes, water|
|Formed elements|45%|Platelets; White blood cells; Red blood cells|

### Haematopoiesis and White Blood Cell Lineages

- **Haematopoiesis:** The formation of blood cells from **hematopoietic stem cells** in the **bone marrow**.
    
    - Bone marrow is the source of all blood cells.
- **Two major lineages:**
    
    - **Myeloid lineage** (innate immune cells):
        - Produces **erythrocytes (red blood cells)**, granulocytes (e.g. neutrophils), monocytes, dendritic cells, and platelets.
    - **Lymphoid lineage** (adaptive immune cells):
        - Produces **B** and **T lymphocytes**.

**Key Visual:**

![[Pasted image 20250529143821.png|638x354]]
- _Summary_: A block diagram distinguishes between myeloid (innate) and lymphoid (adaptive) derived cells, crucial for understanding immune system structure.

## 2. Innate Immune Cells: Granulocytes and Agranulocytes

### Granulocytes: Neutrophils and Mast Cells

- **Neutrophils:**
    - Most abundant leukocyte (**~75%**).
    - Highly **phagocytic** (“eat and kill”).
    - Numbers rapidly increase during infection.
    - Circulate in blood; can enter tissues during inflammation.

**Visual:**

- _Summary_: Shows the typical appearance and granularity of neutrophils.
    
- **Mast cells:**
    
    - Not found in blood; line **mucosal surfaces**.
    - Release granules attracting other white blood cells to tissue damage.

**Visual:**

### Agranulocytes: Monocytes, Macrophages, Dendritic Cells

- **Monocytes:**
    - Blood-resident, relatively low **phagocytic activity**.
- **Macrophages:**
    - Differentiate from monocytes after leaving the blood and entering tissue (found in spleen, liver, etc.)
    - High **phagocytic activity**.
    - Can be **resident (sessile)** or **migratory** in tissues.

**Visual:**

![[image-5.png]]
    
- _Summary_: Shows transformation from monocyte (in blood) to macrophage (in tissue), highlighting functional change.
    
- **Dendritic cells:**
    
    - Found in low numbers in blood and at sites contacting the environment.
    - **Phagocytic**.
    - **Key bridge** to adaptive immune response: critical for triggering T cell activity.

**Visual:**

![[image-6.png]]
- _Summary_: Illustrates unique morphology for environmental sampling and antigen presentation.

### Movement of Immune Cells through Blood and Lymph

- **Cells are transported** in both **blood** and **lymph**.
- Immune cells exit blood to enter tissues when needed (especially during infection/inflammation).
- **Lymphatic vessels** collect fluid (“lymph”) from tissues and return it to the blood via **lymph nodes**.
- **Key concept:** Lymph nodes act as filtering and activation sites for immune cells.

**Visual:**

![[image-8.png]]
- _Summary_: Demonstrates how immune cells and fluid circulate between tissues, blood, and lymph nodes.

## 3. Phagocytic Cells and Their Functions

### Monocytes vs. Macrophages

- **Monocytes:**
    - Circulate in blood; limited phagocytic ability.
- **Macrophages:**
    - Once in tissues, become highly active at engulfing and destroying microbes.

### Functions of Macrophages

- **Three key functions:**
    1. **Phagocytosis:** Engulf and destroy pathogens.
    2. **Release of chemical messengers:** Modulate inflammation and attract other immune cells.
    3. **Antigen presentation:** Display pathogen pieces (“antigens”) to **T cells** to help activate adaptive immunity.

**Visual:**

- ![Macrophage as "professional eater" (dinner plate metaphor)](https://platform.openai.com/playground/N/A)
- _Summary_: Emphasises macrophages’ role as the main ‘eaters’ in the innate immune system.

### Role of Dendritic Cells

- Phagocytic like macrophages.
- Essential for **triggering adaptive immunity**—present antigens to T cells in the lymph nodes.
- Found especially at the interface with the environment (e.g., skin, mucosa).

## 4. Recognition of Pathogens by Innate Immunity

### Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)

- **PAMPs** are **shared molecular structures** found on many pathogens but **not on host cells**.
- Enable innate immune cells to quickly identify invaders.
- Analogy: Different ‘creations’ (e.g. LEGO Minion, truck, house) all have the same ‘brick’—immune system looks for the universal ‘bricks’ unique to microbes.

**Visual:**

- ![LEGO analogy: Different objects, same building block](https://platform.openai.com/playground/N/A)
- _Summary_: PAMPs are like common building blocks; the immune system targets these for broad microbial detection.

### PAMP Examples: Bacteria and Viruses

- **Bacteria:**
    
    - **Cell wall**: **Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)** or **Endotoxin** (Gram-negative), **Lipoteichoic acid** (Gram-positive)
    - **Flagella**: **Flagellin** protein
    - **Nucleic acid**: **Unmethylated CpG DNA**
- **Viruses:**
    
    - **Nucleic acids**: **Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)**, **double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)**
    - Typical viral PAMPs do not include LPS or flagellin.

**Table: PAMP Examples by Pathogen Type**

|Pathogen|Structural Components|Common PAMPs|
|---|---|---|
|Viruses|Envelope, Nucleocapsid, Nucleic acid|ssRNA, dsRNA|
|Bacteria|Capsule, Cell wall, Cell membrane, Flagella|LPS, lipoteichoic acid, flagellin, unmethylated CpG DNA|

**Visual:**

- _Summary_: Visually reinforces structural differences but also the common molecular signatures detected by innate immunity.

#### Example: SARS-CoV-2

- **SARS-CoV-2** (COVID-19 virus) is recognised mainly through its **ssRNA** genome, a classic **viral PAMP**.

**Visual:**

- ![Electron micrograph of SARS-CoV-2 showing spike protein](https://platform.openai.com/playground/N/A)
- _Summary_: Highlights that viral structure (especially nucleic acids) is key for immune recognition.

**Revision MCQ Example** Q: A common virus-associated pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) is:

- a) unmethylated CpG DNA
- **b) ds RNA** (Correct: a key viral PAMP!)
- c) ss DNA
- d) lipopolysaccharide/endotoxin

### Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs)

- **PRRs** are protein receptors that detect PAMPs.
- **Toll-like receptors (TLRs):** Major PRR family, found on/inside phagocytes.
- When PRRs bind PAMPs:
    - Trigger **cell signalling** to the nucleus leading to changes in **gene transcription** (e.g., expression of cytokines, upregulation of antimicrobial activity).
- Some TLRs detect PAMPs at the cell surface (e.g., LPS), others inside phagolysosomes (e.g., viral or bacterial nucleic acid).

**Visual:**

## 5. Inflammation and Fever

### Definition and Mechanism of Fever

- **Fever (Pyrexia):**
    
    - Defined as **abnormally high body temperature (>37°C)**.
- **Mechanism:**
    
    - The **hypothalamus** resets the body’s “thermostat.”
    - Triggered by **pyrogens**: molecules released mainly by immune cells.
- **Key pathway:**
    
    - **Phagocytes** (especially macrophages) ingest bacteria → release pyrogenic **cytokines** (notably **interleukin-1 (IL-1)**).
    - IL-1 travels to the hypothalamus, initiating fever response.

**Visual:**

- ![Unwell child with thermometer; concept of fever](https://platform.openai.com/playground/N/A)
    
- _Summary_: Real-life context for fever, a cardinal sign of infection.
    
- **Fever feedback loop:**
    
    - ↑ phagocytosis → ↑ IL-1 → ↑ temperature (fever)
    - ↓ phagocytosis → ↓ IL-1 → ↓ temperature

### Adaptive Advantage of Fever

- **Why fever can help:**
    
    - Higher temperatures may inhibit some bacteria/virus growth.
    - Enhances immune cell activity (e.g., speeds up reactions or cell migration).
- **Important note:** _Excessively high fever can be dangerous and is regulated tightly._

## 6. Summary and Exam Tips

- **Know the key components of blood, especially the different leukocyte types, origins, and functions.**
- **Understand innate immune cell roles:** granulocytes (neutrophils, mast cells), monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells.
- **Phagocytic cell importance**: How monocytes become macrophages and their three essential immune functions.
- **PAMPs and PRRs:** Learn the main PAMPs for bacteria (LPS, flagellin, CpG DNA) and viruses (ssRNA, dsRNA), and how PRRs (like TLRs) recognise these patterns.
- **Fever mechanism and function:** IL-1 as a pyrogen, hypothalamic reset, and benefits (and risks) of fever.
- **Movement of immune cells:** From blood to tissues and via the lymphatic system.

**Pitfalls:**

- Confusing myeloid (innate) and lymphoid (adaptive) lineages.
- Assuming all immune cell types are equally phagocytic or found everywhere (e.g., mast cells are not in blood).
- Misidentifying PAMPs (e.g., LPS is not found on viruses; dsRNA is not found on bacteria).

**Tips/Connections:**

- Relate the location and movement of each immune cell type to its function (e.g., dendritic cells in tissue → activate adaptive immunity in lymph nodes).
- Focus on how innate detection (via PAMPs and PRRs) rapidly initiates defence and influences the adaptive response.
