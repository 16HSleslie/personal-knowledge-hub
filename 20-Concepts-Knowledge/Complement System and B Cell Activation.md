### Explanation
Classical pathway is triggered by antibody binding to pathogens.
All pathways converge on C3 convertase, leading to:
- Labelling pathogens for phagocytosis (opsonisation)
- Destruction of pathogens (lysis)
- Recruitment of immune cells
Complement fragments bound to antigens can help activate B cells , enhancing antibody production.
