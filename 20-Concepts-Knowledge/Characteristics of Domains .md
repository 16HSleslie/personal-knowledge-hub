The key differences between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells, is that membrane-enclosed organelles are only present in eukaryotes. Some other key differences between the three domains are outline in the table:

| Characteristic                                    | Bacteria | Archaea | Eukarya |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Nuclear envelope                                  | No       | No      | Yes     |
| Membrane enclosed<br>organelles                   | No       | No      | Yes     |
| Peptidoglycan in cell wall                        | Yes      | No      | No      |
| Circular chromosome                               | Yes      | Yes     | No      |
