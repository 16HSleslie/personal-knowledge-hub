HUBS 191 Jeff Erickson – Department of Physiology Lecture 23 Neurophysiology 3: Sensory Receptors Example exam question Which of the following statements about neurotransmitters is NOT correct? A. Neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles. B. Neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft when calcium levels rise. C. Neurotransmitters are degraded by enzymes to terminate synaptic transmission. D. Neurotransmitters are transported into the post- synaptic cell through chemically-gated channels. 2 Objectives and Study Guide After this lecture you should be able to: • Describe the three types general types of sensation • Understand the difference between tonic and phasic receptors • Summarize the functions and features of sensory receptors • Describe how the intensity and location of a stimulus affects your perception of that stimulus Related reading: Martini et al. Modules 13.2 (p. 532), 13.16-13.17 (p. 539-541), and 13.19 (p. 545) 3 Afferent vs. Efferent Signals Afferent signals are sent to the central nervous system to give us information about our environment and our body homeostasis Once you’ve processed this information, the central nervous system sends instructions to the rest of the body using efferent signals. Afferent Efferent 4 Afferent information is transmitted via sensory signals Somatic senses: • Perception of physical senses, like touch and temperature • Can provide information about external or internal environment • Tend to be highly specific in terms of location/direction • Typically sensed by the skin, muscle, and joints Visceral senses: • Visceral means “deep down”…refers to senses that monitor your internal organs • Often difficult to pinpoint a precise location, instead more of a generalized sense of well-being (or not) • Examples are feeling full after a big meal, or feeling nauseous when ill Special senses: • Detected by highly specialized organs or structures • Examples are vision (eyes), smell (nose), and taste (tongue & nose) 5 Transduction means to convert or change from one form to another. Sensory transduction is the conversion of a sensory stimulus into an action potential. Sensory detection requires stimulus transduction Pexels.com 6 From touch to action potential • when you touch something with your finger • …a mechanoreceptor in the skin of your fingertip gets squished. • This deforms the membrane, opening mechanically-gated Na+ channels • …allowing Na+ to enter and depolarize the membrane • …sending action potentials to the brain to make you aware of the touch. Stimulus Transduction - Example Pexels.com 7 Tonic (slow-adapting) vs Phasic (fast-adapting) Receptors • Continually active to reflect background level of stimulation • AP frequency changes when stimulus intensity changes • Example: proprioceptors (body position) • Slow adapting • Normally silent (No APs) • Send APs with change but stop quickly • Example: temperature receptors • Fast adapting Tonic Receptors Phasic Receptors What’s the benefit of adaptation? 8 Sensory receptor types: Thermoreceptors Thermoreceptors: • are nerve endings with temperature-gated ion channels • respond to different temperatures and also changes in temperature • are phasic (fast-adapting) Transduction of temperature stimuli: • Temperature stimuli open temperature-gated Na+ channels • Allowing Na+ to enter and depolarize the membrane • If threshold is reached in the thermoreceptor, an AP will fire and propagate to the brain 9 Chemoreceptors: • are specialized receptor cells with chemically-gated ion channels • translate changes in chemical concentration to action potentials • can be fast or slow-adapting depending on the chemical and location • examples include oxygen, CO2, and acid receptors • more about this in HUBS192 Sensory receptor types: Chemoreceptors Oxygen Carbon Dioxide Breathing Rate 10 Mechanoreceptors: • are nerve endings with mechanically-gated ion channels • respond to physical forces that distort the plasma membrane (deformation) • light touch receptors are typically phasic (fast-adapting), while proprioceptors and baroreceptors are tonic (slow-adapting) Sensory receptor types: Mechanoreceptors Tactile Sensation Sense of touch, including pressure and stretch of the skin Proprioception Sense of body position and movement in space, which comes from stretch receptors in muscles, tendons and joints Baroreception Detect pressure/stretch in vessels within the body 11 Nociceptors: • are nerve endings that respond to noxious stimuli (harmful, painful) typically caused by tissue damage • have either temperature-gated, chemically- gated or mechanically-gated ion channels responding to extreme stimuli (e.g. excess heat or cold; chemical or membrane deformation) • tend to be tonic (slow-adapting), though some are phasic (fast-adapting) Flickr.com PXHerecom Sensory receptor types: Nociceptors 12 Cheat sheet for sensory receptors Each type of receptor is stimulated by a specific type of stimulus Receptor Sense Stimulus examples Tonic or phasic? 1. Thermoreceptor Temperature Relative temperature (ranges) Phasic 2. Chemoreceptor Chemicals CO2, O2, H+ concentration in blood Tonic/Phasic 3. Mechanoreceptor Sub-type: Tactile receptors Skin touch Light touch, pressure, texture, vibration, stretch Mostly phasic 3. Mechanoreceptor Sub-type: Proprioceptor Proprioception (limb position related to the torso/trunk) Stretch or tension in muscle, tendons and joints Tonic 3. Mechanoreceptor Sub-type: Baroreceptor Pressure Stretch of visceral tubes (e.g. blood vessels, airways, intestines) Tonic 4. Nociceptor Pain Excess temperature, chemical or mechanical stimuli Mostly tonic 13 Example exam question If a receptor responds to stimuli with the pattern of action potentials seen in the figure to the right, which of the following is most likely to be CORRECT? A. It is slow adapting. B. It is a phasic receptor. C. It is a thermoreceptor. D. It is normally silent. 14 The intensity of sensation is determined by action potential frequency and number of neurons activated The brain interprets stimulus intensity based on the # of action potentials (APs) arriving from afferent neurons • No APs = no sensation • Some APs = some sensation • More APS = more intense sensation Examples: • Mild stimuli (e.g. soft light, warm surface) causes few APs • Intense stimuli (e.g. bright light, hot surface) causes many APs photo credit: pxfuel.com photo credit: pxfuel.com 15 The intensity of sensation is determined by action potential frequency and number of neurons activated 16 • The area of skin with receptive endings for a single sensory neuron • Each sensory neuron has its own receptive field • Size and density of receptive fields affect discriminatory touch (sensitivity) and ability to localize a stimulus. The receptive field is the area encompassed by nerve endings for a single sensory neuron 17 Large and more widely spaced receptive fields provide: • less sensitivity and • less accurate localization • e.g. in arms, legs, torso Small and densely packed receptive fields provide: • More sensitivity (better two-point discrimination) • more accurate localization • e.g. hand, fingers and lips Fig 16-01, Saladin, 3rd. Edn, 2004 p587. The number and size of receptive fields determines the localization accuracy of sensation 18 Photo credits: Brain Flickr.com, • Somatic sensory neurons send signals from different parts of the body • Up axons within the dorsal column pathway • to the somatosensory cortex of the brain • Creating a somatotopic map Primary somatosensory cortex (Post-central gyrus) Primary somatosensory cortex (Post-central gyrus) Somatic signals are largely interpreted by the somatosensory cortex of the brain 19 Example 1: Trunk/torso and limbs • Areas of skin with larger receptive fields • have less representation in the brain because there are fewer neurons involved • Remember: 1 sensory neuron per receptive field Receptive fields and the somatotopic map Photo credits: Brain Flickr.com, Humunculus man Wikipedia.org Fig 16-01, Saladin, 3rd. Edn, 2004 p587. 20 Example 2: Lips and hands • Areas of skin with smaller receptive fields • have more representation in the brain because there are more neurons involved • Remember: 1 sensory neuron per receptive field Photo credits: Brain Flickr.com, Humunculus man Wikipedia.org Fig 16-01, Saladin, 3rd. Edn, 2004 p587. Receptive fields and the somatotopic map 21 Wrapping up… • Sensation can be broadly classified into somatic, visceral, and special senses • Tonic receptors (slow-adapting) send a constant signal that speeds up and slows down, while phasic receptors (fast-adapting) are silent in normal conditions and send signals when stimulated • Thermoreceptors, chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, and nociceptors are key examples of receptors that contribute to sensory transduction • The intensity of sensation is determined by action potential frequency, while the localization of sensation is determined by the size and number of receptive fields 22 Example exam question Areas of skin with large and widely-spaced receptive fields: A. always yield very intense stimuli. B. are associated with visceral sensation. C. provide a low accuracy of signal localization. D. are common in the fingers, hands, and lips. 23 HUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
