Introduction • On the whole, benzene doesn’t react easily with nucleophiles because the p cloud repels the approach of a nucleophile • Benzene derivatives with a leaving group undergo substitution with difficulty. • A comparison of alkyl and aryl chloride bond strengths indicates why….. Cl • Aromatic C—Cl, 400 kJ mol-1 • shorter CH3CH2 Cl • Alkyl C—Cl, 346 kJ mol-1 • longer 6 1. Introduction NUCLEOPHILIC aromatic substitution CAN occur if • The aromatic ring is electron poor (one or more EWGs) • There is a good, incoming nucleophile AND • There is a good leaving group Remember from SEAr: Strongly Deactivating towards SEAr —NO2 —CN —SO3H —NH3+ —NR3+ Activating/makes nucleophilic Ar substitution easier/possible 7 1. Introduction What makes a good leaving group? • Good leaving groups are weak bases • i.e. the conjugate base of strong acids, e.g. halide ions (I-, Br-, Cl-) water (OH2), and sulfonates https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2011/04/12/what-makes-a- good-leaving-group/ 8 2. Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution There are two main types/mechanisms of SNAr. Part 3 of this lecture: Addition THEN elimination • Requires electron poor benzene ring with electron withdrawing groups either ortho or para to a leaving group. The nucleophile adds, THEN the leaving group is eliminated. Part 4 of this lecture: Elimination THEN addition • Requires a very strong base (amide anion or molten sodium hydroxide). Elimination of the HX, to give a benzyne, THEN addition of a nucleophile (from the base). NO2 X NO2 Nu 9 2. Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution • Both ‘addition then elimination’ and ‘elimination then addition’ for aromatic systems are DIFFERENT to ‘alkyl halide’ substitution reactions • Aryl halides DO NOT undergo SN2 or SN1 NO2 X NO2 Nu Backside attack is geometrically (and electronically) impossible ‘Sole’ loss of leaving group does not occur 10 3. SNAr – addition then elimination mechanism If a benzene ring has: • a good leaving group, and • one or more strongly electron withdrawing substituents either o or p to the leaving group Cl NO2 OH– 160 °C OH NO2 + Cl Cl NO2 OH NO2 + Cl NO2 NO2OH– 100 °C Cl NO2 OH NO2 + HCl NO2 NO2 O2N O2NH2O 40°C 11 3. SNAr – addition then elimination Mechanism – Step 1, addition, the slow step • Nucleophile attacks the carbon bearing the leaving group (X) perpendicular to the Ar ring X NO2 δ+ δ− Nu X NO2 Nu Remember – backside attack is not possible 12 3. SNAr – addition then elimination Mechanism – Step 1, addition, the slow step • The carbanion is resonance stabilized, called a “meisenheimer complex” X NO2 Nu X NO2 Nu X NO2 Nu • The reason an EWG substituent(s) helps is the resonance contributor(s) - X N Nu OO A A X N Nu OO All the resonance contributors are termed the“meisenheimer complex” however this is the most stabilised contributor 13 3. SNAr – addition then elimination Mechanism – Step 2, elimination of X- • X must be a BETTER leaving group than Nu, i.e. the incoming Nu must be a stronger base than X. X NO2 Nu - X- NO2 Nu or X N Nu OO - X- NO2 Nu Any of the resonance contributors can be used to show this elimination step 14 3. SNAr – addition then elimination Factors influencing the reaction • The more electron poor the Ar ring is, the faster the reactions 15 3. SNAr – addition then elimination Example synthesis • The synthesis of trifluralin B, a herbicide. Cl CF3 Cl CF3 NO2O2N HNO3 / H2SO4 N H C3H7C3H7 CF3 NO2O2N N C3H7C3H7 SEAr SNAr BREAK 16 4. SNAr – elimination then addition mechanism Aryl halides without an electron withdrawing group(s) can undergo nucleophilic substitution in the presence of very strong bases such as sodium amide (NaNH2). • e.g. NH3 has a pKa of 43. NH3 + H2O NH2 – + H3O+ 17 4. SNAr – elimination then addition The overall reaction (i.e. substituted product) is the same….. …..but the mechanism if different to section 3 of this lecture, and the nucleophile must be a very strong base This mechanism is less common because of the extreme reaction conditions Cl NaNH2 NH2 + NaCl Cl molten NaOH OH + NaCl 18 4. SNAr – elimination then addition Mechanism – Step 1, elimination of halide (but NOT just ‘directly’) • Believed to be via a benzyne C Cl H NH2 C liquid NH3 benzyne • The mechanism has been studied using 13C …. C Cl NaNH2 C NH2 C = 13C C NH2 + H 19 4. SNAr – elimination then addition Mechanism – Step 2, nucleophile attacks the benzyne C NH2 C NH2 H NH2 C NH2 H + NH2– or NH2 C C NH2 H NH2 + NH2– C NH2 H 20 4. SNAr – elimination then addition There must be a hydrogen adjacent (ortho to) the leaving group C Cl H NH2 C liquid NH3 benzyne Cl NaNH2, NH3 Remember the mechanism…. 21 4. SNAr – elimination then addition The benzyne intermediate is very reactive… Examine a normal alkyne: RR = RR Very good orbital overlap Strong p bond = Poor overlap Weak p bond Examine a benzyne 22 4. SNAr – elimination then addition • There can be ‘substituent directing effects’ but not quite in same way as we saw for SEAr • Remember if there is a strong EWG then the ‘addition then elimination’ mechanism will likely occur • But the ‘elimination then addition’ mechanism can occur with other substituents present….. If the benzyne is not symmetrical then regioisomers could form S S S and, or Nu Nu 23 4. SNAr – elimination then addition • The regiochemistry depends on the stability of the anion formed when the nucleophile attacks in step 2 S S and, or Nu Nu Since the aromatic pi-system is at right angles to the triple bond, what’s NOT relevant is the substituent’s ability to donate the lone electron pair to the ring (like OCH3) , or accept a lone pair from it (like NO2). i.e. no +M or –M The negative charge can only be stablished by –I (inductive effects) Cl NH2 NH2 NaNH2, NH3 OCH3 Cl OCH3 OCH3 NH2 OCH3 NH2 NaNH2, NH3 24 4.
