The endosymbiosis theory stats that the 2 key organelles in eukaryotes (mitochondria and chloroplasts) are derived from bacteria. Mitochondria are derived from proteobacteria, while chloroplasts are derived from cyanobacteria.
These bacteria where engulfed by the ancestors of eukaryotes. This happened twice, first with mitochondria and then for chloroplasts
