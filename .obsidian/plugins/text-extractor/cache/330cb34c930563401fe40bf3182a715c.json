Hence, protons in different directions relative to that carbon atom experience different shielding effects. Pi bond anisotropy (electronic) 61 Alkene Aromatic Pi bond anisotropy (magnetic) 6263 Anisotropic effects are most prominent in unsaturated systems, which possess pi electrons. Pi electrons are more readily polarisable than sigma electrons in saturated systems. 6465 (Resonance) Note ortho and para: 1,3- relationships between donor and acceptor 666768 Compelling evidence of ring currents •intermolecular H-bonding is concentration dependent. Hence, chemical shift can be, and vary between samples 69 Concentration effects 70 Hydrogen bond donors needs acceptors 71 Bottom line: hydrogen bonded protons are fickle and variable to analyse by NMR, this variation can be useful and diagnostic, or confusing. What can you say about the relative hydrogen bond acceptor ability of chloroform, acetone, and acetonitrile? 1H NMR of butanal 72 Chemical shift is characteristic of structure 73 1H NMR of propanol 74 Refer to Lab Manual, Appendix 12 (p82) for detailed chemical shift data 7576","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
