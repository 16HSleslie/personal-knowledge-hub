Progress Test 2 – Saturday 17th May @ 10.30am- 11:15am • If you are unable to sit the test for an unavoidable reason go to the HUBS office ASAP BEFORE 12pm Wednesday 14th May with documentation. • Check your eVision timetable the week of the test to see which venue you must attend as there may be changes. • If you do not attend the test you will get a mark of zero – there is NO PLUSSAGE! • The test comprises 25 multiple-choice questions (options A-D) • Duration of the MCQ TEST is 30 min and you will not be permitted to enter the test after 10:45am. • Material covered = Lectures 16 – 32 inclusive and associated readings, content from Labs 3 and 4 • Bring Student ID card, pencil, eraser • Only List A university approved calculators will be permitted Practice Mini-Essay After 30 minutes, you must finish your MCQs and then have 15 minutes to complete a practice mini-essay under exam conditions. You cannot leave until 11:15 and cannot revisit MCQs during the practice mini-essay time. You can take your practice mini-essay home to self or peer mark against a model answer on Bb. The practice essay does not contribute to your final grade. Illness etc ON THE DAY. In case of illness, or another situation affecting your ability to do the test on the day, you must go to the HUBS office with documentation (see HUBS policy on Health Declaration Certificate on Bb) by 5pm Monday 19th May in order to have your case considered. Objectives To be able to:  List and describe the function of the immune cells in the blood  Give examples of phagocytic cells  Explain how innate cells recognise pathogens  Explain how fever is induced Readings:  Marieb 10e Chapter 21 first part of Section 21.2, page 793 only  Marieb 10e Chapter 21 page 796 (Section “Inflammatory Chemical Release”)  Marieb 10e Chapter 21 page 799 (Section “Fever”)  Marieb 10e Chapter 21 page 804-805 (Section “Dendritic Cells” and “Macrophages”) 2 Obj 1: Immune cells in the blood 3 Blood is composed of plasma and cells Plasma Formed elements 55% 45% Whole blood proteins (including antibodies/immunoglobulin) other solutes water Platelets White blood cells (leukocytes) Red blood cells Martini 3e Fig 17.2 4 Bone marrow Bone marrow stem cells = source of blood cells (hematopoiesis) 5 Blood Cell Lineages  Myeloid → red blood cells (erythrocytes) granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, platelets (innate immune cells)  Lymphoid → B and T lymphocytes (adaptive immune cells) Derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow (see Martini 3e Module 17.3) White blood cells 6 Granulocytes in Blood Neutrophils – 75% of all leukocytes, highly phagocytic “eat and kill” – numbers in blood increase during infection Granulocytes circulate in the blood and can move into tissue during inflammation Lab 6 7 Granulocytes in Tissue  Mast cells • Mast cells line mucosal surfaces (not found in blood) • Release granules (in dark purple) that attract white blood cells to areas of tissue damage 8 Obj 2: Phagocytic cells 9 Monocytes and Macrophages  Monocytes present in blood → low phagocytosis  Leave blood - develop into macrophages in tissues e.g. spleen, liver → high phagocytosis blood tissues monocyte macrophage 10 Macrophages  Macrophage become resident (sessile) or move through tissues (migratory)  3 important functions 1. Phagocytosis (professional eaters) 2. Release of chemical messengers 3. Show information about pathogenic microbes to T cells (linking innate and adaptive immunity) 11 Dendritic cells: linking innate and adaptive immune responses  Found in low numbers blood and all tissues in contact with the environment  Phagocytic  Most important cell type to help trigger adaptive immune responses Marieb 10e Chapter 21 Figure 21.10 12 How do cells of the immune system move around the body?  Cells are carried in the blood and in the lymph  Cells can leave blood to enter tissues  Lymph in tissues collects into lymphatic vessels. These drain lymph into lymph nodes.
