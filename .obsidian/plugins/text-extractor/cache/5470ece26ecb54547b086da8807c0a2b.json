Osmosis works to balance tonicity between the intracellular and extracellular spaces 12 Did you catch it? • What is osmosis? How is it different from normal diffusion? • What do the terms isotonic, hypertonic, and hypotonic mean? • If there is an imbalance of water and solute concentrations on each side of the cell membrane, what will happen?

Tonicity! A saline or Ringer’s solution is relatively isotonic compared to the intracellular fluids of your blood cells…perfect for preserving their osmotic balance.

Hypotonic 18 Extra (ECF) Outside Intra (ICF) Inside High Na+ Low Na+ Low K+ High K+ Both the Na+ and K+ are imbalanced Uneven distribution of molecules across the membrane creates a “chemical gradient” 19 CATIONS Sodium Na+ Potassium K+ Calcium Ca2+ + ANIONS Chloride Cl- Proteins - The cell membrane resists ionic flow + + + + ++ + + + + + ++ + + + + + + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - + + + + + + + + + + + - - Slightly more negative this side Uneven distribution of charges across the membrane creates an “electrical gradient” Slightly more positive this side 20 Chemical and electrical gradients allow rapid signalling in excitable cells • Ions are highly driven to move down their concentration and electrical gradients…to equilibrate the inside and the outside of the cell. • But they can’t! The cell membrane is semi- permeable and won’t allow the ions through. • The moment a pathway opens, the ions will rush in/out along their gradient. • The bigger the gradient, the faster and stronger the signal! What if Tiger? 21 Passive ion channels allow the movement of ions down their chemical/electrical gradients Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.7 p. 456. Extracellular Intracellular 22 The sodium-potassium exchange pump maintains the chemical and electrical gradients across the cell membrane High Na+ Low K+ High K+ Low Na+ Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.7 p. 457. • The sodium-potassium exchange pump is an ACTIVE pump, meaning it uses energy (ATP) to move molecules. • It has to be active, because it’s working against chemical and electrical gradients! • It moves three sodium ions out of the cell and brings two potassium ions into the cell for every ATP used. • This creates chemical gradients for both sodium and potassium, as well as maintaining the electrical gradient (more positives leaving the cell means more negative inside the cell) 23 At rest, the intracellular space has more negative charge than the extracellular space, creating an “electrical gradient”: Resting Membrane Potential High Na+ Low K+ High K+ Low Na+ Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.7 p. 457. 24 Excitable cells (nerves, muscles) use the movement of ions as a signal via depolarization Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.9 p. 460. 25 NERVOUS TISSUE GLIA Electrical Communication Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 4.17 p. 215 What If Tiger? Sodium channels open Depolarization moves down the cell Signal is passed to the next cell 26 Did you catch it? • What are chemical and electrical gradients? What is the resting membrane potential? • At rest, where are the Na+ and K+ ions with respect to the intracellular and extracellular spaces? What gradients are created by the distribution of those ions? • What is the difference between a passive channel and an active pump? • What is a depolarization? What is a repolarization? Courtesy: Giphy 27 Summary • Diffusion is the movement of molecules down a concentration gradient, while osmosis is the movement of water across a membrane to balance tonicity on both sides. • Ions are distributed unevenly across the cell membrane at rest to create chemical and electrical gradients. • At rest, the intracellular space is more negatively charged than the extracellular space. The electrical gradient when the cell is at rest is known as the resting membrane potential. • Positive ions enter the cell during a depolarization, which acts as a signalling event for excitable cells. The positive ions are then removed during repolarization to return to the resting membrane potential. 28 Example exam question If the cell on the left was moved to a hypotonic solution of pure water, which of the following would be most likely to occur? A. Solute molecules would move into the cell, making it heavier. B. Water would move into the cell, making it swell. C. Solute molecules would move out of the cell, disrupting its function. D. Water would move out of the cell, making it shrivel. 29 HUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
