Right adrenal gland Adrenal arteries Left adrenal gland Right kidney Left kidney Abdominal aorta Inferior vena cava 1 Capsule Cortex Corticosteroids - Glucocorticoids - Mineralocorticoids - Sex hormones Medulla Adrenaline + noradrenaline (catecholamines) 3 Adrenal gland histology • Zona glomerulosa • Produces Aldosterone (mineralocorticoid) • Increases sodium reabsorption in kidney and potassium excretion • Aldosterone secretion stimulated by angiotensin II and high potassium • Zona fasciculata • Middle zone • Secretes glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol) • Zona reticularis • Inner zone of adrenal cortex • Secretes adrenal androgens • Role in fetal and pre-pubertal development + mild effects in females after puberty • Adrenal Medulla • secretes adrenaline (80%) and noradrenaline 4 Different groups of neurons in the hypothalamus can: 1. Control secretion of anterior pituitary via releasing hormones (RH) and release inhibiting hormones (RIH) 2. Synthesize hormones secreted by posterior pituitary 3. Directly control secretion of cells in the adrenal medulla © 2018 Pearson Education, Ltd. 5 Adrenal Medulla • Functionally related to the SNS • Neurons in hypothalamus analogous to preganglionic sympathetic neurons - axon terminals release ACh onto nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on chromaffin cells in adrenal medulla’ >> depolarization • Chromaffin cells in medulla are analogous to postganglionic sympathetic neurons (but without axons) • Secrete adrenaline and noradrenaline into blood • Will therefore affect all cells in the body with the right receptors i.e. alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. • G-protein coupled receptors • Exact effect though will also depend on the type of cell © 2018 Pearson Education, Ltd. adrenaline and noradrenaline 6 Physiological Effects of adrenaline/noradrenaline • Activate ‘fight or flight’ responses. • Exact response with depend on: - Which hormone (noradrenaline or adrenaline) - Which receptors are present on the cell - Type of cell (cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, adipose, liver • Generally, will produce effects associated with promoting immediate survival in threatening situations. - Increased heart rate, cardiac output and blood pressure - Increased blood flow to heart and skeletal muscle - Relaxation of smooth muscle in airways - Reduced blood flow to GI tract and kidneys - Pupil dilation, sweating - Glycogen breakdown in muscle and liver - Fat breakdown in adipose tissue 7 Phaeochromocytoma • A rare benign tumour of the adrenal medulla derived from chromaffin cells • Results in increased secretion of: • Adrenaline (Epinephrine) • Noradrenaline (Norepinephrine) Symptoms may include: Tachycardia (↑ heart rate), hypertension (↑ BP) Anxiety / apprehension Hyperglycemia Nausea/vomiting Headache Sweating 8 Estrogen Progesterone testosterone Secretion of corticosteroids Stress Diurnal rhythm 9 — Glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol) Hypothalamus Anterior Pituitary Adrenal Cortex CRH + + ACTH — Control of glucocorticoid secretion • Hypothalamic neurons secrete corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) – peptide hormone • CRH acts on anterior pituitary causing it to secrete ACTH in diurnal pattern • Peak early morning, trough late afternoon • Other factors increasing CRH secretion include: • Physical stress or trauma • hypoglycemia • Emotional stress e.g. fear • Infection 10 Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) • ACTH is a peptide hormone produced by corticotropes cells of the anterior pituitary • ACTH acts on the inner 2 layers of the adrenal cortex (zona fasiculata and zona reticularis) - Glucocorticoids - Sex hormones (mostly androgens) • ACTH binds with G-protein coupled receptors in adrenal cortex • ACTH Increases cortisol and adrenal androgen synthesis by increasing expression/activity of steroidogenic enzymes. Adrenocortical hormones are bound to plasma proteins in blood e.g cortisol-binding globulin or albumin 11 Glucocorticoids help resist physiological stress • Increase responsiveness to catecholamines (so help maintain BP) • Increase gluconeogenesis in the liver - synthesis of new glucose from amino acids, glycerol, lactate, etc • Mobilizes amino acids from extrahepatic tissues especially muscle • Promotes mobilization of lipids from fat • Increased free fatty acids and glycerol in plasma • Decreases glucose utilization particularly in muscle cells • More glucose available in blood for brain cells • Increased BGL then stimulates secretion of insulin, but tissues less sensitive to insulin’s effect due to action of glucocorticoids >> insulin resistance. • Reducing/limiting inflammatory and/or immune reactions. cortisol 12 Function and Regulation of Aldosterone • Secreted by cells of Zona glomerulosa in response to: • Activation of the renin-angiotensin system ( i.e angiotensin II) • High ECF potassium • Low ECF sodium • Aldosterone acts on nephrons in kidney to increase reabsorption of sodium • Sodium is main ECF cation and a major determinant of ECF volume (and therefore blood pressure) • Increases renal excretion of potassium in urine • Aldosterone can also promote reabsorption of sodium by epithelial cells of sweat, salivary glands, and in the intestines Aldosterone Renin Angiotensin II Low renal BP 13 Cushing’s Syndrome • This is due to an excess of glucocorticoids and may result from: • administration of exogenous corticosteriods such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, dexamethasone, etc • 2 o to overproduction of ACTH (Cushing’s disease) • some hypothalamic or ant. pituitary tumours • Other tumours that may oversecrete ACTH • Adrenal neoplasia • Adenoma (benign) • Carcinoma (malignant) Marieb’s Human Anatomy and Physiology, 10th Ed., 2016, figure 16-15, p 639. 14 Manifestations of Cushing’s • Increased protein catabolism with loss of muscle • Increased gluconeogenesis and impaired insulin response • Hypertension • Osteoporosis (inhibits osteoblasts) • Hirsuitism • Immunosuppression • Thin skin that tears and bruises easily • Striae (stretchmarks) • Psychological changes • “moon face” • “buffalo hump” •  abdominal fat 15 Addison’s Disease (1 oadrenal insufficiency) John F Kennedy Notice the far thinner face of his brother Robert, behind him. Jane Austen describes “sufferings [of] feverish nights, weakness and languor” and also concern for her “looks,” which turned “black and white and every wrong colour.” Jane died of Addison’s in 1817 http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~jmp/JeremyLO2.html 16 Atrophied adrenals Hyperpigmentation due to   ACTH Addison’s Disease Causes include: • Autoimmune adrenalitis • Infections e.g. TB • metastatic cancer Loss of BOTH glucocorticoids (cortisol) AND mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) • Altered metabolism and difficulty maintaining BGL • Low sodium, BP and ECF volume • Hyperkalaemia (high potassium) • Weakness, weight loss ’Addisonian Crisis’ may lead to shock and death. Treatment = replacement of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid 17 The Stress Response – some things have changed…. 18 © 2018 Pearson Education, Ltd. Alarm Phase (“Fight or Flight”) Sympathetic stimulation Adrenal medulla General sympathetic activation Adrenaline, noradrenaline Immediate Short-Term Responses to Crises 1 Responses that are going to help you to survive physical threats (seconds to hours) • Increased alertness and ability to focus • Dilated pupils • Increased heart rate, cardiac output and BP • More blood flow to heart, skeletal muscles • Increased respiratory rate and O2 consumption • Smooth muscle in airways relaxes • Reduced bloodflow to kidneys and gut • Increased breakdown of glycogen in muscle • Mobilization of liver glycogen >> ↑ BGL • Increased sweating Alarm Phase These responses can also be triggered by emotions or other psychic stimuli. 19 Resistance Phase Sympathetic stimulation ACTH Renin- angiotensin- aldosterone system Pancreas Adrenal cortex Aldosterone (+ ADH) cortisol Growth hormone Longer-Term Metabolic Adjustments Glucagon 2 Longer term responses (hours, weeks, months) • Breakdown of proteins and fat to provide substrates for liver to produce new glucose (gluconeogenesis) - cortisol, glucagon, GH (fat only) • Switch in metabolism of many tissues to using lipids as energy source ‘spares’ available glucose for the brain • Increased BGLs • Conservation of sodium and water but loss of potassium. 20 Exhaustion Phase 3 Exhaustion Phase • Exhaustion of protein and lipid reserves - energy reserves finally depleted - Structural integrity of tissues compromised • Inability of maintain acceptable blood glucose concentration - Hypoglycemia in starvation - Insulin resistance in ‘chronic mental or emotional stress’ • Failure to maintain adequate fluid and electrolyte balance • Cardiovascular damage due to prolonged elevation in blood volume, BP, BGL etc Duration, symptoms and outcome will Vary by individual and depending on the particular type of stress 21 HUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
