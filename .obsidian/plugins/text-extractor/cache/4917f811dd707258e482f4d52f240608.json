HUBS 191 Jeff Erickson – Department of Physiology Lecture 18 Neurophysiology 1: Action Potentials Objectives and Study Guide After this lecture you should be able to: • Describe three types of gated ion channels associated with neurons • Define a local potential • Describe (not calculate) how summation occurs at the axon hillock • Describe the five steps that comprise an action potential Related reading: Martini et al. Modules 9.5 (p. 365), 11.6-11.11 (p. 455- 465), and 11.13 (p. 468-469) 2 Neurons communicate with each other using chemical signals Every neuron to neuron synapse has: • a pre-synaptic neuron that releases neurotransmitter • a post-synaptic neuron that senses neurotransmitters and reacts by opening ion channels Note: Neurons can be both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic at the same time! Electrical signal Electrical signal Electrical signal Chemical signal Chemical signal Chemical signal Chemical signal 3 How does a chemical signal get converted into an electrical signal? • A chemical signal (neurotransmitter) binds to and opens chemically-gated ion channels • Ions flow in or out, changing the voltage at a localized area of membrane • If the membrane voltage reaches -60mV at the axon hillock… • …an electrical signal (action potential) begins Electrical signal Chemical signal -60mV 4 • Think of the stimulus as the ‘key’ that opens a channel • Think of the channel as a ‘door’ • Think of the ‘ions’ as the people that walk through the door if it opens Stimulus: a chemical (e.g. neurotransmitter) Stimulus: a voltage (e.g. -60mV) Stimulus: membrane deformation (e.g. stretch) Gated ion channels are opened by a stimulus Chemically-gated ion channel Voltage-gated ion channel Mechanically-gated ion channel Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.8 p. 458-9. 5 Chemically-gated ion channels are opened by a chemical stimulus 1. Stimulus = chemical neurotransmitter binds to ion channel 2. Channel changes shape (i.e opens) 3. Ions cross the membrane driven by their electrochemical gradient 4. The neurotransmitter unbinds, causing the channel to closeMartini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.8 p. 458. 6 1. Stimulus = membrane depolarizes to threshold voltage (e.g. -60mV) 2. Channel changes shape (i.e opens) 3. Ions cross the membrane driven by their electrochemical gradient 4. Membrane potential changes will cause the channel to inactivate or close Voltage-gated ion channels open when they sense a (sufficiently large) change in voltage Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.8 p. 458. 7 1. Stimulus = deformation of the membrane (e.g. stretch or squish) 2. Channel changes shape (i.e opens) 3. Ions cross the membrane driven by their electrochemical gradient 4. When the membrane returns to original shape the channel closes Mechanically-gated ion channels are opened by stretching or deformation of the membrane Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.8 p. 459. 8 Dendrites & Cell body Axon Axon terminals Voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels Chemically-gated Na+ and Cl- (& others) channels Voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels Axon hillock Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels Where are the various types of gated ion channels on a neuron? Na+ = Sodium K+ = Potassium Cl- = Chloride Ca2+ = Calcium Dendrites Cell body Axon hillock Axon Axon terminals Note: Mechanically-gated ion channels are found on dendrites of some sensory neurons. More detail in Lec 23. 9 At rest, the intracellular space has more negative charge than the extracellular space, creating an “electrical gradient”: Resting Membrane Potential High Na+ Low K+ High K+ Low Na+ Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.7 p. 457. 10 Local potentials are a change in voltage (charge) in a specific area of the cell What is a local potential? • An excitatory or inhibitory change in voltage… • …in a small location (localised area) somewhere on the dendritic/cell body membrane… • …of a post-synaptic cell (Note: it depends on which synapse you’re looking at to determine if a cell is pre- or post-synaptic) Local potentials can also be called: • Post-synaptic potentials (PSP) • Because they occur on the membrane of the post-synaptic cell • Graded potentials • Because they vary in size depending on how many ions enter/exit 11 EPSP = Excitatory Post-Synaptic Potential (i.e. an excitatory local potential) How do EPSPs form? • A presynaptic neuron releases excitatory neurotransmitter (example: acetylcholine - ACh) • When neurotransmitter binds, it opens chemically-gated Na+ channels • Na+ enters post-synaptic cell, causing depolarization (membrane becomes more positive/+) Excitatory local potentials (or EPSPs) Excitatory Presynaptic neuron Post-synaptic neuron EPSP 12 Inhibitory local potentials (or IPSPs) Inhibitory Presynaptic neuron IPSP = Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Potential (i.e. an inhibitory local potential) How do IPSPs form? • A presynaptic neuron releases inhibitory neurotransmitter (example: GABA) • When neurotransmitter binds, it opens chemically-gated K+ or Cl- channels • K+ exits or Cl- enters post-synaptic cell, causing hyperpolarization (membrane becomes more negative/-) Post-synaptic neuron IPSP 13 Did you catch it? • What is a local potential? At what part of a neuron does it occur? • What are excitatory local potentials? What are inhibitory local potentials? Are they associated with depolarization or hyperpolarization events, and what does this mean for the charge at that area of the neuron? • What ion channels are associated with excitatory and inhibitory local potentials, and which way are the ions moving? Warner Bros. Pictures 14 Example exam question Chemically-gated channels in neurons are: A. very sensitive to membrane deformation. B. highly concentrated in the axon. C. typically opened when neurotransmitters bind. D. constantly open. 15 How does a chemical signal get converted into an electrical signal? • A chemical signal (neurotransmitter) binds to and opens chemically-gated ion channels • Ions flow in or out, changing the voltage at a localized area of membrane • If the membrane voltage reaches -60mV at the axon hillock… • …an electrical signal (action potential) begins Electrical signal Chemical signal -60mV 16 Post-synaptic neuron Local potentials are summed in two ways: • Spatial summation – summed input from multiple pre-synaptic neurons • Temporal summation – summed input from repeated firing of one pre-synaptic neuron Note: usually both are occurring simultaneously in a complex neural network Pre-synaptic neurons Summation of local potentials is the combination of excitatory and inhibitory potentials 17 Example of summation in a post-synaptic neuron Neuron 2 Fires 2 times +5mV each Neuron 4 Fires 2 times -2mV each Neuron 3 Fires 4 times -3mV each Neuron 1 Fires 10 times +2mV each Neuron 1 10 x +2mV = +20mV Neuron 2 2 x +5mV = +10mV Neuron 3 4 x -3mV = - 12mV Neuron 4 2 x -2mV = - 4mV Total +14mV Resting membrane potential (RMP) of post-synaptic neuron Example: summed inputs depolarize post-synaptic membrane to -56mV Note: you don’t need to calculate this in HUBS191! 18 Summation at the axon hillock can lead to an action potential Resting membrane potential (RMP) -70mV Why are pre-synaptic inputs summed at the axon hillock? • The axon hillock has a high density of voltage-gated channels • Threshold potential (-60mV) is the key that opens voltage-gated channels • Thus, if summation occurs, to or above -60mV, voltage-gated Na+ channels open at the axon hillock (recall -56mV example from last slide) Threshold potential -60mV E.g. Summed input 19 RMP -70mV Step 1 – Voltage-gated (VG) Na+ channels open when membrane depolarizes to -60mV Step 2 – Massive influx of Na+ causes ‘rapid depolarization phase’ of the action potential Changes in membrane potential during an action potential Threshold potential -60mV Action potential - steps 1 & 2 VG Na+ VG K+ VG Na+ VG K+ Threshold Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.10 p. 462-3. 20 Action potential - step 3 Changes in membrane potential during an action potential Step 3 – Roughly +30mV • VG Na+ channels inactivate (get blocked) - Na+ entry stops • VG K+ channels open - K+ exits • K+ exiting causes the ‘repolarization phase’ of the action potential VG Na+ VG K+ Note: VG K+ channels are triggered to open at -60mV but open more slowly than VG Na+ channels. Threshold Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.10 p. 462-3. 21 Action potential - steps 4 & 5 Changes in membrane potential during an action potential Step 4 – VG K+ channels begin to close, but close slowly • This permits excess K+ to exit, causing the ‘hyperpolarisation phase’ of the action potential • Membrane potential goes as low as about -90mV Step 5 – All VG K+ channels close, the membrane returns to -70mV VG Na+ VG K+ VG Na+ VG K+ Step 5 Threshold Hyper- polarisation Martini - Visual Anatomy and Physiology (2018) Module 11.10 p. 462-3. 22 Did you catch it? • What are the five steps that make up an action potential? What approximate voltage is associated with each step? • What is the open/closed status of the Na+ and K+ channels during each step of the action potential? • If I pointed to an area on the action potential, could you describe what’s happening? GifsRC.blogspot.com 23 How does a chemical signal get converted into an electrical signal? • A chemical signal (neurotransmitter) binds to and opens chemically-gated ion channels. • Can be inhibitory or excitatory • Ions flow in or out, changing the voltage at a localized area of membrane. • Adding these ion movements together is called summation • If the membrane voltage reaches -60mV at the axon hillock… • The axon hillock contains lots of voltage-gated Na+ channels • …an electrical signal (action potential) begins. • Coordinated movement of ions leads to depolarization, repolarization, and hyperpolarization Electrical signal Chemical signal -60mV 24 Example exam question At the point indicated by the red arrow: A. the neuron is hyperpolarizing. B. voltage-gated Na+ channels have opened. C. the neuron is waiting for sufficient summation at the axon hillock. D. the rapid repolarization phase has begun.
