MHC-I presents **exogenous antigens** that originated within the cell (e.g. viral protein), it is expressed only on antigen presenting cells
Antigen proteins are degraded in the **phagolysosome** (acidic compartment)

### Steps
1. APCs (e.g. dendritic cells) phagocytose extracellular antigens
2. Antigenic proteins are degraded in the acidic phagolysosome
3. Peptides are loaded onto MHC-II molecules within the phagolysosome
4. MHC-II/peptide complexes are transported to the cell surface for recognition by CD4+ T cells (helper T cells)
