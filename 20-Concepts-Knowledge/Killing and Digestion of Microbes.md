Phagolysosome is the vesicle where ingested microbes are killed and digested

Explanation:
Microbes are destroyed inside phagolysosome by:
- Low pH - Acidic environments denatures proteins
- Reactive oxygen intermediates - e.g. hydrogen peroxide
- Reactive nitrogen intermediates - e.g. nitric oxide
- Enzymes - Proteases (break down proteins), lipases (break down fats), nucleases (break down nucleic acids)
