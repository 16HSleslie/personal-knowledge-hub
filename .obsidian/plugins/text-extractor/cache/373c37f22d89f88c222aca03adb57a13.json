Lecture objectives • Define the three types of joints in the musculoskeletal system • Describe the structures of synovial joints and explain how this contributes to movement • Describe the different shapes and movements of synovial joints 2 L5 answers 3 For interest only: 1. Which of the following tissues/structures resists both compression and tension? A. Ligament B. Tendon C. Hyaline cartilage D. Fibrocartilage 2. ________ allow bones to grow in length while growth in width occurs via __________. A. primary ossification centres; secondary ossification centres B. growth plates; appositional growth C. appositional growth; epiphyseal plates D. osteoclasts; osteoblasts Joint Classifications 4 For interest only: • Fibrous = least amount of movement • Ligaments hold bones together • e.g. cranial sutures • Cartilaginous = some movement • Fibrocartilage holds bones together • e.g. pubic symphysis • Synovial = most amount of movement Synovial Joints • Free moving • Most limb joints • Amount of, and direction of, movement is determined by joint structure 5 Martini & Nath, Fundamentals of Anatomy & Physiology, 8th Edn, 2009 Why do we need different classes of joints? What would happen if: • Your distal tibiofibular joint was synovial? • Your pubic symphysis or intervertebral discs were fibrous? • What if your shoulder or hip joints were cartilaginous? 6 Synovial Joint Features 7 Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018proximal end of femurdistal end of femur • Complex association of tissues and structures • Facilitation of free movement AND control of movement • Bone ends determine the range of motion at a joint – Bony congruence – Compare hip vs knee Synovial joint structure 8 Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 • Bone ends • Articular cartilage • Joint capsule • Joint cavity – potential space • Synovial membrane – synovial fluid filling cavity • Ligaments Synovial joint structure 9 Hyaline (articular) cartilage • Covers bone ends where they articulate – subchondral bone • Smooth, frictionless movement Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018 Synovial joint structure 10 Joint capsule • Outer layer of DFCT • Inner layer of synovial membrane – Secretes synovial fluid – Lubrication of joint – Nutrients to avascular structures Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 Synovial joint structure 11 Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 Joint capsule • Holds bones together • Tight and thick where more support is required • Loose where movement is allowed Synovial joint structure 12 Capsular ligaments • In some joints, thickenings of capsule are present where more support is needed • e.g collateral ligaments of knee – medial collateral ligament (MCL) • Connects femur to tibia • Restricts abduction – Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) • connects femur to fibula • restricts adduction Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018 Synovial joint structure 13 Intracapsular ligaments • In some joints, additional bands of DFCT located internally to the capsule hold bones together • e.g cruciate ligaments of knee – Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) • ant. of tibia to post. of femur • restricts post. displacement of femur – Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) • post. of tibia to ant. of femur • restricts ant. displacement of femurAnatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018 Synovial joint structure 14 • Fibrocartilaginous pads • In some joints, small structures made of fibrocartilage – fill in space – provide cushioning/shock absorption – and/or deepen articulations • E.g. menisci (pl.)/meniscus (sing.) in the knee – half-moon shaped structures that sit between femur and tibia Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018 Fibrous and cartilaginous Synovial e.g. fibrous joint e.g. knee joint 15 Stability Mobility Stability vs Mobility Trade off between stability and mobility 16 Stability Mobility Stability vs Mobility 17 Quiz Which part(s) of a synovial joint: a) ensures smooth, frictionless movement? b) holds bones together? c) influence the possible movements at a joint? 18 Joint movement 19 • Range of movement/motion (ROM) – type and amount of movement • Determined by: – bone end shape – ligament location and length – body surface contact – muscles (see L10) • Planes • Axis (plural – axes) • Uniaxial (one axis) • Biaxial (two axes) • Multiaxial (many axes) Coronal Sagittal Transverse Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 Synovial joint movements 20 • Plane • Hinge • Pivot • *Condylar • *Ellipsoid • Saddle • Ball & Socket Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.335 *Different to your textbook Types of synovial joints 21 • Multiaxial • ‘Sliding’ & ‘gliding’ • Flat articular surfaces • e.g. intercarpal and intertarsal joints Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 Plane joint 22 • Uniaxial • Movements are flexion and extension • e.g. ankle, elbow (humerus with ulna), interphalangeal joints Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 Hinge joint 23 • Uniaxial • Movement is rotation • e.g. radioulnar joints, C1-C2 vertebrae Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 Pivot joint 24 • Biaxial • Flexion & extension • Rotation (when flexed) • e.g. knee, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 Condylar joint 25 • Biaxial • Flexion & extension • Abduction & adduction • Therefore also circumduction • NO rotation • e.g. wrist joint (radiocarpal joint) Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 Ellipsoid joint 26 • Biaxial (+) • Flexion & extension • Abduction & adduction • Therefore also circumduction • Obligatory rotation – opposition • e.g. carpometacarpal joint (base of thumb) Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 Saddle joint 27 • Multiaxial • Flexion & extension • Abduction & adduction • Therefore also circumduction • Rotation • e.g. shoulder & hip Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 Ball & Socket joint 28 • Move around the joints in your upper and lower limbs • Think- what type of joint is each one? • What type of movement can you do at each joint? Use the proper terminology! • What planes do those movements occur in? Around what axes? Your body is your personal study sheet! So practicing these movements and testing yourself will help prepare you for exams! Tips for remembering joints: 29 Mini-Essay Practice 30 For interest only: • Mini-Essays test your knowledge, ability to link ideas/concepts, and ability to communicate • Sometimes it’s a one-page piece of writing (see past exam papers) • Sometimes we break the essay into smaller questions/smaller spaces (we’ll practice this in L9/10) • Need to write in sentences, using appropriate terminology • Each takes ~15 mins to brainstorm and write Compare the structure and function of the three classes of joints. Include a description of the tissues involved, and a specific example of each class of joint. • The three classes of joint are defined by the amount of movement they have • Synovial joints have common structures, plus some joints have additional features • Synovial joints move a lot! – there are 7 types of synovial joint • The amount and direction of movement is determined by joint structure: • Bone end shape • Capsule & ligaments (location & length) • Body surface contact Practice movements at your joints. Think about what planes they are in, and therefore what axes they are moving around Lecture summaryHUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
