Nucleic acids are informational molecules and include:
- Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
- Ribonucleic acid (RNA).

There are polymers of monomers called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a 5 carob deoxyribose sugar, 1-3 phosphate group, and a nitrogen-containing base.
The bases that are found in nucleic acid are either:
- Thymine (T)
- Adenine (A)
- Guanine (G)
- Cytosine (C), DNA only
- Uracil (U), RNA only

DNA and RNA differ in structure, as RNA only has a single helix structure while DNA has a double helix structure, Also the base cytosine only appears in DNA, while uracil only appears in RNA.
