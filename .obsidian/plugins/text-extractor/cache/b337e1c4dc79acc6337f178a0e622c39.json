Phagocyte mobilisation. Marieb p797 4 Inflammation makes capillaries leaky. Neutrophils squeeze out of leaky capillaries and enter tissue. Neutrophils are attracted to the site of infection by chemicals released from damaged / infected cells, or associated leucocytes (especially macrophages) Bacteria are phagocytosed. Lysosomal enzymes (e.g. acid hydrolases) in the phagolysosome kill the bacteria. Example of physical barrier: constant replacement of cells (shared property of skin and mucosa). Immunity to pathogens is usually a combination of cell mediated immunity and antibody production e.g. Optimal anti-viral immune responses require CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and B cells (for antibody production – especially neutralising IgG) 5 Phagocytes phagocytose pathogens, and cytotoxic T cells release perforin and granzyme to induce apoptosis in infected cells 6 CD8 TCR MHC-I peptide DC CTL apoptosis Perforin / granzyme Viral antigen Virus- infected cell TCR MHC-II CD4peptide CD4 ‘Help’ CD8 MHC-I / Peptide TCR Viral proteins can enter both the phagolysosome and cytosol of DC: - Phagosomal antigen will be loaded onto MHC-II for CD4 (helper) T cell stimulation - Cytosolic antigen will be loaded onto MHC-I for CD8 T cell stimulation 7 Cell death (apoptosis) CTL Virally-infected cell Kills using perforin and granzyme Viral Peptide TCR MHC-I Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes CTL kill virus infected cells using perforin and granzyme 8 DC Bacteria B cell Antibody production TCR MHC-II CD4peptide ‘Help’ Native antigen CD4 Plasma cell Bacterial proteins enter the phagolysosome of DC: Phagosomal antigen will be loaded onto MHC-II for CD4 (helper) T cell stimulation Helper T cells stimulate B cells to make antibody. Only B cells that recognise antigen are activated. AntibodyClass (Isotype) switching: The class or isotype alters the function of the antibody (not the specificity). (IgM→IgG→IgA→IgE) Activated B cells divide and differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibody, as well forming a separate population of memory B cells. At the second encounter with antigen, Memory B cells are more numerous and are rapidly stimulated by antigen to become plasma cells. Secondary immune responses are characterised by the predominance of class-switched antibodies: IgG, IgA and IgE 9 B cell Antigen B cell B cell Clonal selection: Selective expansion of lymphocytes that interact with antigen This B cell is specific for the native antigen. It is activated and undergoes extensive cell division (also requires CD4 T cell help). These B cells are not specific for the native antigen and will just sit there chilling... 10 T cellPhagocyte TCR MHC peptide Clonal selection: Selective expansion of lymphocytes that interact with antigen T cell These T cells are not specific for the peptide and will just sit there chilling...

Several different antibodies may target a single type of microbe. The term native antigen means that the antigen does not have to be processed to peptide (or in context of MHC). Antibodies can recognise just about any structure! Antibodies binding to defined regions (antibody binding sites) on a larger structure Epitopes Antibody binding site = “epitope” Fc domain (‘constant region’) Variable region 15 Rearranged in bone marrow (during generation of diversity) CH1 CH3 VH VL CL Antigen binding site CH2 CH1 CH2 CH3 VH VL CL Antigen binding site Fc Constant region may switch during immune response. (IgM/D→IgG→IgA→IgE)Fc region binds to FcR on phagocytes or mast cells (IgE only) 16 B cell receptor (BCR) gene rearrangement blood Lymph node Isotype switching (during immune response) Bone marrow 17 Isotypes of antibody: during the immune response, B cells can genetically the switch the heavy chain to change class (isotype). This does not change the antibody-specificity, but does change the function of the antibody.
