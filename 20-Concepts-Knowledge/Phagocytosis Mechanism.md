Phagocytose is the process by which certain immune cells ingest and  destroy microbes of debris.
Phagocytes are cells capable of phagocytosis (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils)

Explanation: 
- Adherence - phagocyte binds to pathogen or debris
- Engulfment - phagocyte extends pseudopods, surrounding the target and forming a phagosome
- Fusion - Lysosome fusses with phagosome, forming a phagolysosome
- Digestion - Pathogen is destroyed by toxic compounds and enzymes
- Exocytosis - indigestible material is expelled
