**Immune cell communication** Is essential for coordinating response to pathogens and linking innate and adaptive immunity.

### Methods of Communication:
- **Soluble molecules** (cytokines or chemokines) bind to specific receptors on cell membrane
- **Cell surface-bound receptors** interact with ligands on other cells, altering the function of one or both cells
- **Antigen presentation**: Fragments of pathogen (antigen) are displayed on cell surfaces and recognised by receptors on other immune cells.

### Explanation
**Soluble Molecules**:
- **Cytokines** and **chemokines** are released by the immune cells and bond to specific receptors on target cells, altering their behavior
- **Cytokines** can increase or decrease gene expression, altering growth and activity.
- **Chemokines** direct cell movement (chemotaxis)

**Cell Surface interactions**:
- Direct connection between immune cells via surface-bound receptors and ligands can alter function of one or both cells

**Antigen presentation**:
- Fragments of pathogens (**antigens**) are displayed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and recognised by T cells, leading to T cell activation.

### Key terms
- **Antigen** - anything that can be recognised by the immune system. Can be foreign (pathogens, transplants) or self (normally tolerated).
- **PAMP** - pathogen-associated molecular pattern.
- **TLR** - toll-like receptor
