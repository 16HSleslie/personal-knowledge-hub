- Classical pathway - triggered by antibodies bound to pathogens
- Alternate pathway - Triggered by direct binding of complement to pathogen surfaces.
- Lectin pathway - Triggered by microbial carbohydrates binding to complement.

## Convergence and Amplification
- All pathways lead to formation of C3 convertase (an enzyme complex).
- C3 convertase amplifies the response and leads to three main outcomes

Outcomes:
- Label - Opsonisation: coating of microbes with antibody's and /or C3b (a complement fragment); enhances recognition and ingestion of pathogens
- Recruit - C3a and C5a (complement fragments) act as chemoattractant; attract phagocytes to the site of infection; induce mast cell degranulation, releasing inflammatory mediators
- Destroy - Membrane Attack Complex (MAC): Formed by C5b, C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9 molecules; invert pathogen membrane, forming pores and causing lysis
