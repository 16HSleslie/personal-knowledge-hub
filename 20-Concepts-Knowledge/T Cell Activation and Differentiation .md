**CD4 T cells** recognise *MHC-II/peptide* complexes
- They provide help to CD8 T cells and B cells

Explanation:
Upon activation, CD4 T cells secrete cytokines that:
- Assist CD8 T cells in becoming cytotoxic (CTLs)
- Stimulate B cells to differentiate into plasma cells and produce antibodies.


**CD8 T cells** recognise *MHC-I/peptide* complexes
- They differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)

Explanation:
Activated CD8 T cells kill infected or abnormal cells by releasing *perforin* and *granzyme*, inducing **apoptosis**


### Co-receptors (CD4 & CD8)
- **CD4** co-receptors binds to *MHC-II*
- **CD8** co-receptors bind to *MCH-I*

Explanation:
Co-receptors stabilise the interaction between TCR and MCH/peptide complexes, ensuring T cell activation
