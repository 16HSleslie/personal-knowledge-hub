However, they have more roles than this and they are often specific to a cell type.\nOne of their roles is signal transduction. The protein relay messages from the body or environment into the cell, telling the cell to do things such as grow, divide, move, etc.\nIt may have a binding site with a specific shape that fits the shape of a chemical messenger, such as a hormone. Another role is cell recognition.

The bonds between amino acids is called a peptide bond, so a polymer of amino acids is called polypeptide.\nExample of proteins that carry out different functions include:\n- Collagen (structural)\n- Insulin (regulatory)\n- Actin and myosin (contractile)\n- Haemoglobin (transport)\n- Albumin (storage)\n- IgG (protective)\n- RNA polymerase (catalytic)\n- Botulinum (toxic)\n```"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":""}]},"responses":[{"timestamp":1748849101523,"id":"chatcmpl-BdtpJQhEr4MWusmgoPPVXy9eddNQ3","object":"chat.completion","created":null,"choices":[{"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Your notes are organized within a directory named `20-Concepts-Knowledge`, and they cover several fundamental biological concepts, primarily focusing on cell biology, the characteristics of life, and biomolecules.

So the concentration of a substance may  be higher inside than in the surroundings.\n```\n20-Concepts-Knowledge/Linking Innate and Adaptive Immunity Example.md\n```md\n### Explanation\n1. Physical barrier (skin) is breached\n2. Pathogen enter the body\n3. Chemical mediators cause vasodilation; phagocytes enter tissue to destroy pathogens\n4. Complement system is activated\n5. Dendritic cells recognise pathogens, becoming activated, and migrate to lymph nodes\n6. Dendritic cells present to T cells MHC\n7. T cells and complement help activate B cells.\n8. B cells produce antibodies\n9. Complement, phagocytosis, and antibodies work together to clear pathogen\n```\n20-Concepts-Knowledge/Evolution.md\n```md\nWhen organisms that vary, pass on their characteristics, and survive differentially, you get evolution.\n```\n20-Concepts-Knowledge/Immune Cell Communication.md\n```md\n**Immune cell communication** Is essential for coordinating response to pathogens and linking innate and adaptive immunity.\n### Methods of Communication:\n- **Soluble molecules** (cytokines or chemokines) bind to specific receptors on cell membrane\n- **Cell surface-bound receptors** interact with ligands on other cells, altering the function of one or both cells\n- **Antigen presentation**: Fragments of pathogen (antigen) are displayed on cell surfaces and recognised by receptors on other immune cells.\n### Explanation\n**Soluble Molecules**:\n- **Cytokines** and **chemokines** are released by the immune cells and bond to specific receptors on target cells, altering their behavior\n- **Cytokines** can increase or decrease gene expression, altering growth and activity.\n- **Chemokines** direct cell movement (chemotaxis)\n**Cell Surface interactions**:\n- Direct connection between immune cells via surface-bound receptors and ligands can alter function of one or both cells\n**Antigen presentation**:\n- Fragments of pathogens (**antigens**) are displayed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and recognised by T cells, leading to T cell activation.\n### Key terms\n- **Antigen** - anything that can be recognised by the immune system. Can be foreign (pathogens, transplants) or self (normally tolerated).\n- **PAMP** - pathogen-associated molecular pattern.\n- **TLR** - toll-like receptor\n```\n20-Concepts-Knowledge/Facilitated Diffusion.md\n```md\nFacilitated diffusion allows the movement of hydrophilic molecules across membranes. This requires membrane proteins called channels and carriers. Still, no energy is required because these substances are moving down their concentration gradient, but they need to be aided because they are hydrophilic substances. The channel proteins may open or close in response to some signals, and carrier undergo a shape change to help guide the molecule.\n```\n20-Concepts-Knowledge/Domains of Life.md\n```md\nBy identifying shared characteristics, we can start to build a family tree of organisms. These family tress are called phylogenetic trees.

The phospholipids have hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails.\nMembrane fluidity changes depending on whether the hydrocarbon tails of the phospholipids are unsaturated (some double bonds) or saturated (no double bonds). When they are unsaturated, there are kinks in the tails where the double bonds are located, so they cannot pack as tightly together. This causes a more fluid membrane. However, when they are saturated, they can pack much closer together and therefore the membrane is much more viscous. The addition of cholesterol within animal cell membranes stabilises membrane fluidity by reducing phospholipid movement.\n```\n20-Concepts-Knowledge/Polysaccharides .md\n```md\nPolysaccharides are lots of monosaccharides linked together (more than 10). \n```\n20-Concepts-Knowledge/Regulation of receptors.md\n```md\n- Sensitivity of target cells to hormones depends on the number of receptors they have (or 'express')\n- To allow constant adjustment of receptor numbers, cells can degrade (down-regulate) or synthesise (up-regulate) receptors which will in turn decrease the cell's response to a give hormones\n```\n20-Concepts-Knowledge/White Blood Cells.md\n```md\nProduction\n**Hematopoiesis** is the process of forming new blood cells in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells.\nBlood cell lineage divides into:\n**Myeloid lineage** - Gives rise to red blood cells, granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and platelets\n**Lymphoid lineage** - gives to B and T lymphocytes (adaptive immune system)\n```\n20-Concepts-Knowledge/Dendritic Cells and Activation of Adaptive Immunity.md\n```md\n**Dendritic cells (DCs)** are critical for linking innate and adaptive immunity.\n**Activated dendritic cells** communicate with T cells via:\n- Cytokine secretion\n- Cell surface receptor-ligand interaction\n- Antigen presentation\nExplanation:\n- DCs recognise pathogens via PAMPs, become activated, and migrate to lymph nodes.\n- In lymph nodes, DCs present antigen to T cells using MHC molecules, secrete cytokines, and engage in direct receptor-ligand interactions.\n- This communication activates T cells, bridging innate detection and adaptive response.\n```\n20-Concepts-Knowledge/Major Histocompatibility Complex (MCH).md\n```md\nMHC is proteins on cell surface that present antigen fragments to T cells.\nTypes of MHC:\n- **MHC-I** - Presents endogenous (intracellular) antigens; found on all nucleated cells.\n- **MHC-II** - Presents exogenous (extracellular) antigens; found only on professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) like dendritic cells.\n### Explanation\n**Antigen presentation**:\n- MHC molecules display processed antigen fragments on cell surface\n- T cell receptors recognise (TCRs) specific antigen-MHC complexes, leading to T cell activation.\n**Functional difference**:\n- **MHC-I**: Alerts cytotoxic T cells to infected or abnormal cells.\n- **MHC-II**: Alerts helper T cells to external threats detected by APCs\n```\n20-Concepts-Knowledge/Cytokines.md\n```md\n**Cytokines** are signalling molecules that regulate immune cell growth and activity.
