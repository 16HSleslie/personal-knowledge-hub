**B cells activation** requires binding to the BCR and often "help" from CD4+ T helper cells.
Activated B cells differentiate into:
- Plasma cells - secrete antibodies.
- Memory B cells - persist for rapid response upon re-exposure.

Explanation:
B Cells are activated when their BCR bind to a specific antigen. T cells help (from CD4+ T cells) is often required for full activation and class switching.
