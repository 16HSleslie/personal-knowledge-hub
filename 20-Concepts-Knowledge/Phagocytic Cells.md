Phagocytosis is the process by which certain immune cells engulf and destroy microbes and debris

Major phagocytic cells:
- Neutrophils
- macrophages
- Dendritic cells

Importance:
- Critical first line defence - removing pathogens before infection can spread
- Initiate signals that attract and coordinate further immune response
