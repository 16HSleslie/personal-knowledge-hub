Bone changes depending on how you use your body! 4 Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2020 Bone can repair itself • Bone cells also respond to trauma to unite broken parts 5 Bone tissue composition • Connective tissue ➢ Supports other tissues/organs ➢ Maintains form • Bone has two extracellular components: ➢ Organic ➢ Inorganic Anatomy Teaching Resources, University of Otago, 2018 6 Extracellular components – the organic bit 33% of bone ECM is organic ➢ Collagen (protein) ➢ Ground substance (proteoglycans) ➢ Function = resists tension • This fibula with its collagen removed is brittle/breaks easilySaladin, Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2004 7 67% of bone ECM is inorganic ➢ Hydroxyapatite + other Ca minerals (mineral salts) • This bone has had its inorganic components removed making it too flexible! Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.259 Extracellular components – the inorganic bit Mineral component makes bone hard & resistant to compression. 8 The cellular component of bone • Makes up just 2% of bone by weight • Four types of cells ➢ Osteogenic cells ➢ Osteoblasts ➢ Osteocytes - Mature bone cells ➢ Osteoclasts • Together these cells maintain bone homeostasis ➢ Balance of bone destruction and formation that means amount of bone stays the same 9 • Osteogenic cells ➢ Stem cells that produce osteoblasts • Osteoblasts ➢ MAKERS - Produce new bone matrix • Osteocytes ➢ MAINTAINERS - Recycle protein and minerals from matrix • Osteoclasts ➢ DESTROYERS - remove bone matrix What do bone cells do? 10 Gross structure of bones • Reminder: there are two types of bone tissue ➢ Compact ➢ Cancellous • Made of the same things but structured differently ➢ Osteon structure (compact) ➢ Trabecular structure (cancellous) Patton & Thibodeau, Anatomy & Physiology, 7th Edn, 2010 11 Compact bone • Macroscopically: ➢ Outer surfaces seem dense and impenetrable (periosteum) ➢ Foramina/holes for blood supply • Microscopically: ➢ Made up of circumferential lamellae and units called osteons Surface of a femur (top = midshaft, bottom = distal). Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018 Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.260 12 Osteons • Osteon= longitudinal (lengthwise) unit within compact bone. ➢ provide a pathway for nutrients to get to cells in the ECM • Central canal - contains blood vessel and nerves • Lamellae - a series of cylinders formed of ECM around the central canal. ➢ Form the shape of the osteon ➢ Collagen fibres within lamellae resist forces • Lacunae= ‘lakes’ for osteocytes • Canaliculi = channels for nutrients to travel to osteocytes through the ECM Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.260 13 Zooming out a bit… Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.260 osteons Circumferential lamellae Interstitial lamellae 14 Osteon Central canal Lamellae Lacunae Canaliculi 15Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.261 Cancellous bone • Trabeculae ➢ Struts of lamella bone • Marrow fills the cavities between trabeculae • Osteocytes housed in lacuna in between lamellae/on surface. Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018 Lacuna and osteocyte Canaliculi 16 Why trabecular bone? • Organisation of trabeculae resists force from multiple directions • Directs force from body weight in single direction down shaft • Spreads force distally Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.25617 Palastanga et al, Anatomy and Human Movement, 1992 Weight transmission upper – lower body • Trabeculae channel weight around the ilia into femora 18 Bone Remodelling • Allows bones to grow - appositional growth • Osteoblasts add bone matrix in lamellae to bone surface • Osteoclasts remove bone from the medullary cavity. Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.262 19 • Balance of OB and OC activity. • Bone is constantly being formed/destroyed • Allows body to mobilise calcium, phosphate and other minerals from the bone matrix • Process called REMODELLING • Allows bone to respond plastically • Shape change possible through life to resist strain etc. Bone homeostasis 20 What happens if bone homeostasis isn’t maintained? • Body has requirements to maintain homeostasis • E.g. adequate calcium in diet, moderate exercise. • Without these can get an imbalance in osteoblastic/ osteoclastic activity. 21 Imbalance in OB/OC activity • Osteoporosis and osteopenia = OC > OB activity • Osteoporosis = clinically significant version 22 Osteoporosis • Loss of cortical bone • In cancellous bone trabeculae become thinner • Compression fractures of vertebrae Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.343 23 Why do only some people get osteoporosis? • Biological females more at risk ➢ Loss of estrogen post- menopause • Lifestyle factors ➢ Lack of exercise ➢ Nutritional factors • Depends on your start point ➢ Peak bone mass in your 20s ➢ If this is already low then more likely to get osteoporotic 24 Module 6.3 – 6.6 in Martini et al. 2018. Visual Anatomy and Physiology Shout out (again) to this video that has a really nice explanation of osteon structure and bone cell types from 5:07- 6:25 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDGqkMHPDqE I need to revise this stuff… 25 Practice: Complete these sentences! Compact bone is composed of units called The found in the centre of each osteon provide a pathway for blood vessels and nerves. The cells in bone are called and sit within structures called . 26 What is the extracellular component of bone made of? A. Osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes B. Hydroxyapatite (mineral) and collagen (organic) C. Osteons D. Trabeculae 27 How do bones grow wider (appositionally)? A. Osteocytes secrete bone and widen the osteons. B. Osteoclasts hollow out bone from the medullary cavity C. Osteoblasts add bone to the outer surface D. A combination of B and C. 28 What is bone homeostasis? A. When OB and OC activity are balanced and net bone mass stays the same B. When osteocytes are functioning properly C. When normal growth allows an increase in bone mass. D. The process by which bones stay the same once they’ve finished growing. 29 HUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
