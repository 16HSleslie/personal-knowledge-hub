Escher Fish & Frogs Steric Acceleration CHEM202 Lecture Problem How would you make 11-acetoxyandrostan-3-ol from androstane-3,11-diol? Steric Compression Look at this in the setting of the cyclohexane ring. Axial substituents suffer destabilising 1,3-diaxial interactions: • In reaction where an axial bond is broken: – Relief of steric strain may be considerable. May lead to a rate enhancement – i.e. an axial derivative may react faster than its equatorial epimer • Characteristic feature: – Reaction takes place at ring atom rather than at group attached to ring - Endocyclic attack H H X side viewtop view Oxidation of Secondary Alcohols Chromic acid (H+/Cr2O7 2-) converts 2o alcohols into ketones: Evidence for slow step: – Isotope labelling studies: • Based on the fact that a C-2H bond is stronger than a C-1H bond • Compare oxidation rates for cholestan-3-ol and 3- deuterocholestan-3-ol - get a ratio of 7:1 • Only expect a large rate difference if the C-H bond is broken in the slow step of the reaction (rate determining step) – Reaction rate increases if a stronger base is used H +/Cr2O7 2- R 1 C R 2 H OH R 1 R 2 O Axial Reacts Faster than Equatorial Note that the rate controlling step involves: • Conversion of a tetrahedral (sp3) carbon into a planar (sp2) geometry – attack at an endocyclic centre – For an axial ROH get relief of strain from 1,3-diaxial interactions – For most equatorial ROH get little steric relief • Removal of a proton by a base (H2O) – exocyclic attack – This is easier for an equatorial hydrogen Thus, for an axial alcohol the two factors combine. An axial alcohol oxidises faster than its equatorial epimer Simple Cyclohexanols 4-tert-butylcyclohexanols: • Cis-isomer: – Has an axial OH – Reaction removes 1,3-diaxial interactions – H2O has easy approach towards the equatorial hydrogen (CH3)3C eq OH ax H Simple Cyclohexanols 4-tert-butylcyclohexanols: • Cis-isomer: – Has an axial OH – Reaction removes 1,3-diaxial interactions – H2O has easy approach towards the equatorial hydrogen (CH3)3C eq OH ax H (CH3)3C ax OH eq H • Trans-isomer: – Has an equatorial OH – Reaction provides little steric relief – Approach of H2O to the axial hydrogen is more difficult • Thus, the cis-isomer reacts more rapidly than the trans Steroidal Alcohols Relative rate data for oxidation of a range of cholestanols: Axial Equatorial 1-ol 13.0 1-ol 9.7 2-ol 20.0 2-ol 1.3 3-ol 3.0 3-ol 1.0 4-ol 35.0 4-ol 2.0 6-ol 36.0 6-ol 2.0 7-ol 12.3 7-ol 3.3 11-ol 900.0 11-ol 14.0 Note: • An axial ROH always reacts faster than its equatorial epimer • The most reactive axial ROH are the most sterically hindered • A hindered equatorial ROH will also react rapidly 2 3 4 1 6 7 11 H H H H cholestane Selective Syntheses • Use combinations of oxidation, acetylation and hydrolysis • Use principles discussed over the last 2 lectures • Design selective syntheses of multifunctional steroids – A game of logic Game Rules (Limited sub-set) Selectivity • Axial Groups – oxidation fast – hydrolysis and esterification slow • Equatorial Groups – oxidation slow – hydrolysis and esterification fast Protection • OAc group is not oxidisedLecture Problem Design syntheses of: • 2-hydroxyandrostan-6-one • 6-hydroxyandrostan-2-one starting from androstane-2, 6-diol Recap/Tute Represent as regular polygons Each unspecified vertex is a C with enough H to give 4 bonds Name by adding cyclo to alkane name Molecular shapes dictated by minimisation of: – Bond Angle Strain - bond angles will be as close as possible to the ideal – Torsional Strain - adjacent bonds will be as close to staggered as possible – Van der Waals Interactions - close approach of non-bonded atoms will be avoided if possible Irreversible Ring Formation • Irreversible ring formations are controlled by the rate of product formation (kinetic control) • The lower the activation energy, the faster the product will form E Slower Faster Reactant Product Reversible Ring Formation • These reactions are under thermodynamic control • Equilibrium composition reflects the stability of the ring system • Cyclized products may only be isolated if the ring has little strain Hemiacetal Formation • Results when an alcohol and an aldehyde are treated with acid (CHEM 191) C O R H H+ C O R H H C O R H H C O R1 H H R2 OH C O R 1 H H R 2 O H C O R1 H H R2 O + H+ Cyclic Ethers • Alkoxide + alkyl halide  ether (SN2 reaction – CHEM 191) • If both functions are part of the same molecule  cyclic ether • Not reversible - halide ion (nucleophile) cannot displace alkoxide ion (poor leaving group) • Rate of reaction strongly dependent on ring size. Observations: – 3  5 > 6 > 4  7 > 8 – 8-membered ring: • High degree of polymerisation • Rate of internal reaction is very slow • Intermolecular reaction becomes competitive – 9 to 11-membered rings do not form The anti-periplanar Transition State for E2 The full geometric requirements for E2 are described as anti-periplanar: •X,C,C,Y are in one plane •X and Y are on opposite sides of the C-C bond This geometry allows for maximum orbital overlap for formation of the new -bond: Consequences can be seen in: • geometry of products • ease with which the reaction proceeds X Y X+ Y- Best overlap if p lobes in same plane Newman Projections of Cyclohexane • chair form – ideal, all bonds staggered • boat - 2 sides with eclipsing bonds H H CH2 CH2 H H CH2 H CH2 H H H Exam Tips • Past papers are always a good idea • Study now to save work later • Come and see me if you need help","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
