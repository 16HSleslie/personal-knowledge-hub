(3)The ankle is an important region of the lower limb. Write an essay on the structure and function of the ankle, including the following components:ii) Outline the changes in position of the ankle joint throughout both swing and stance phases of the gait cycle, including the roles of muscles. (3)iii) Describe how severe damage to the tibialis anterior would impact the normal gait cycle. (2)For tomorrow, brain storm i) then turn it into 1 short paragraph. Summary•The structure, location and type of contraction of muscle influences the movements it produces at a joint•Muscle action and role changes depending on the movement•There are 16 named muscles to know in HUBS19134HUBS191Copyright Warning NoticeThis coursepackmay be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
