Lecture objectives • Describe the general principles of bone growth • Describe the microanatomy of tissues in the joints, and explain how their structure reflects function • Describe fibrous and cartilaginous joints 2 The story so far... • We know: • Basic tissues • Bone tissue • Bones form the skeleton • We need to know: • How bones grow (shape and size) • How bones fit together (joints) • How bones are held together (soft tissues) 3 Bone growth 4 • Start with cartilage model • ~6 weeks after fertilisation • Endochondral ossification • Process of turning cartilage into bone Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.264 & 267 Start of calcification Blood vessels and osteoblasts external Blood vessels (and osteoblasts) internal Primary ossification centre developed Primary ossification centres • Diaphysis (shaft) is primary ossification centre • Epiphyses remain cartilage 5 Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018 Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.264 & 267 Secondary ossification centres • Epiphyses • same ossification process as primary centres • Separated from diaphysis by epiphyseal plate/growth plate 6 Growth plate Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.264 & 267 Bone growth 7Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 For interest only: • In length: • Enabled by epiphyseal plates • aka ‘growth plates’ • formed of cartilage • Starting from puberty, epiphyses start to fuse with diaphyses Child vs Adult 8 https://radiopaedia.org/ Bone growth 9 For interest only: • In width: • Appositional growth • Osteoblast activity produces circumferential lamellae • Osteoclasts mould bone shape and form medullary cavity Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.262 Marieb & Hoehn, Human Anatomy & Physiology, 10th Edn, 2018 For interest only: How does our skeleton move? 10 For interest only: • Bones articulate at joints • A joint: • holds bones together • involves bone ends • involves soft tissues • allows control of movement Key soft tissues 11 For interest only: • Cartilage • Hyaline (articular) • Fibrocartilage • DFCT • Ligaments • Tendons • Joint capsules Cartilage 12 For interest only: • Chondrocytes • in lacuna • Collagen fibres embedded in ground substance • Avascular • No blood vessels • nutrients diffused through matrix by joint loading • Two key types in joints: • Hyaline (articular) • Fibrocartilage Hyaline (articular) cartilage 13 For interest only: • Function = resist compression • High water content in matrix • Sparse collagen fibres Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.206 Hyaline (articular) cartilage 14 For interest only: • Moulds to surfaces of bones where they articulate • Creates smooth surface = frictionless movement • Found on articulating surfaces of bones • Degrades with age Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018 Fibrocartilage 15 For interest only: • Function = resist compression AND tension • Many collagen fibres in bundles • Orientation of fibres aligns with stresses Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.206 Fibrocartilage 16 For interest only: • Useful at joints that experience both compression and tension • Acts as buffer/shock absorber • distribute force over wider area • Deepens articular surfaces Hyaline vs Fibrocartilage 17 For interest only: Hyaline cartilage Fibrocartilage Marieb & Hoehn, Human Anatomy & Physiology, 10th Edn, 2018 DFCT 18 For interest only: • Fibroblasts • Collagen fibres • (Some) elastin fibres • Tightly packed • Function = resist tension • Little vascularity • Slow to heal Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.204 Ligaments 19 For interest only: • Connect bone to bone • Collagen and elastin • resist tension • allow a little stretch and recoil • Restrict movement (away from themselves) Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018 Tendons 20 For interest only: • Connect muscle to bone • Less elastin than ligaments • Facilitates and controls movement • Contraction of muscles transmitted to bone Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.204 Bony congruence 21 For interest only: • Sum of bone surfaces that form an articulation • Less congruence = more soft tissue support needed True or False? 22 For interest only: • Tendons connect bone to bone • The primary centre of ossification is the epiphysis • Hyaline cartilage has a high water content Joint Classifications 23 For interest only: • Fibrous = least amount of movement • Cartilaginous • Synovial = most amount of movement Some terminology: 24 For interest only: • Tissue • cells grouped together in a highly organized manner according to specific structure and function • e.g. DFCT • Structure • something formed of a tissue • e.g. ligament Fibrous joints 25 For interest only: • Tissue = DFCT • Structure = ligament • Function = • limit movement • provide stability • E.g. cranial sutures • stability for skull • Protects brain Netter, Atlas of Human Anatomy, 2004 Fibrous joints 26 For interest only: • Tissue = DFCT • Structure = ligament • Function = • limit movement • provide stability • E.g. distal tibiofibular joint • stability for ankle • Prevents rotational movements at ankle joint Anatomy Resource Collection, University of Otago, 2018 Cartilaginous joints 27 For interest only: • Tissue = fibrocartilage • Structure = varies • Function = some movement • Bones connected entirely by fibrocartilage • E.g. Intervertebral disc Martini et al, Visual Anatomy & Physiology, 3rd Edn, 2018, p.267 Cartilaginous joints 28 For interest only: • Tissue = fibrocartilage • Structure = varies • Function = some movement • Bones connected entirely by fibrocartilage • E.g. pubic symphysis Marieb & Hoehn, Human Anatomy & Physiology, 10th Edn, 2018 Synovial joints 29 For interest only: • Tissues = many • Structures = many • Function = allow lots of movement • E.g. most joints in appendicular skeleton • Details next lecture Practice questions 30 For interest only: 1. Which of the following tissues/structures resists both compression and tension? A. Ligament B. Tendon C. Hyaline cartilage D. Fibrocartilage 2. ________ allow bones to grow in length while growth in width occurs via __________. A. primary ossification centres; secondary ossification centres B. growth plates; appositional growth C. appositional growth; epiphyseal plates D. osteoclasts; osteoblasts Mini-Essay Practice 31 For interest only: • Compare the structure and function of the three classes of joints. Include a description of the tissues involved, and a specific example of each class of joint. • Brainstorm what you know so far (2 out of 3 joints) & we’ll look at an answer tomorrow! • Bone begins as cartilage, then undergoes ossification • primary and secondary ossification centres • Bone growth requires growth/epiphyseal plates, and appositional growth • Joints require connective tissues • Cartilage • DFCT • The three classes of joint are defined by the amount of movement they have Lecture summary 32 HUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
