Lecture Objectives (Updated) - Discuss the location and structure of the thyroid and parathyroids. - Outline the synthesis and the secretion of thyroid hormones and their effects. - Explain how thyroid hormone secretion is controlled. - Outline selected disorders relating to the thyroid. - Recognise signs and symptoms of hypo and hyperthyroidism - Outline the importance of plasma calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis and how this is regulated by parathyroid hormone and calcitonin. - Explain the formation of calcitriol (active Vitamin D) and how this affects calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization. - Identify the disorders that occur in children and adults if calcitriol is deficient Thyroid Gland -Location Hyoid bone Thyrohyoid membrane Vagus nerve Phrenic nerve Superior thyroid artery and vein Inferior thyroid artery Inferior thyroid veins Recurrent laryngeal nerves Superior laryngeal nerve Pyramidal lobe Common carotid Internal jugular vein Brachiocephalic veins Superior vena cava Subclavian artery Subclavian vein Ext. jugular vein Immediately below larynx, anterior and on each side of trachea Very vascular and one of the largest endocrine glands Right lateral lobe Left lateral lobe Isthmus You don’t need to know the names of these blood vessels or nerves yetThyroid Gland • Secretes thyroid hormones • Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) • Iodine attached to tyrosines which then get linked • Two benzene rings confers lipid solubility • > 90% of thyroid hormone in blood is T4 • Most of the T4 is converted to T3 in the tissues • 99% T3 and T4 attached to plasma proteins in blood i.e. thyroid-binding globulins or albumin • Thyroid gland composed of follices • Follicles filled with a large glycoprotein (thyroglobulin) secreted by cuboidal cells that comprise the follicular walls • Thyroglobulin also referred to as colloid Parafollicular (C-cells) lie between follicles and secrete calcitonin (peptide) • Secretion triggered by increased ECF calcium concentration • Reduces osteoclast activity and shifts balance toward deposition in bone • Inhibits reabsorption of calcium by kidney (so more calcium lost in urine) • Lowers ECF calcium levels via above 2 mechanisms • Generally has the opposite effect to PTH (see later) but much less important. © 2018 Pearson Education, Ltd. 3 4 5 2 6 1 7 Tyrosine molecules with attached iodine atoms become linked, forming molecules of thyroid hormones that remain in thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin (contains T3 and T4) Thyroglobulin is broken down, releasing amino acids and thyroid hormones to be recycled. Follicle cells remove thyroglobulin from the follicle cavity by endocytosis. Iodide is converted to iodine and attached to tyrosine portion of thyroglobulin. T3 and T4 diffuse into bloodstream. Iodide ions are actively transported into the cytoplasm. Thyroid-binding globulins (TBGs) transport T3 and T4 molecules.

Thick tongue & a saddle nose He still has his primary teeth http://www.hsc.missouri.edu/ Adult Hypothyroidism Simple Goitre • i.e. not associated with any other disease process e.g. cancer or autoimmune process • May be due to Iodine deficiency • Low levels of thyroid hormones • High TSH >> excessive growth of thyroid tissue Autoimmune disease • where immune cells attack own thyroid gland e.g. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. • Thyroid swollen but produces less thyroid hormone than usual http://www.endocrineweb.com/goiter.html Adult Hypothyroidism – Signs and Symptoms • Reduced metabolic rate • slowed heart and cardiac output • Fatigue and sluggishness (both mental and physical) • Depression • Weight gain • Increased sensitivity to the cold • Muscle weakness • Constipation • Goitre (depending on cause) Picture courtesy of Dr Herbert Langford You don’t need to list all of these signs and symptoms (there are others too) but the ones shown here should make sense if you understand how thyroid hormones work to increase basal metabolic rate, etc In severe cases there can be an edematous (swollen) appearance throughout the body = myxedema which can lead to coma and death if not treated Hyperthyroidism • There are several causes of hyperthyroidism, but the most common cause of is Graves’ disease • Autoimmune disease whereby antibodies attach to TSH receptors and act to stimulate (rather than destroy) the thyroid cells • This leads to overproduction of thyroid hormones HYPERthyroidism as well as an associated goitre • The antibodies can also cause swelling of tissues around/behind they eyes >> exopthalmus Marty Feldman 1933-1982 Hyperthyroidism: Signs and Symptoms • Increased heart rate and BP • Palpitations • Heat intolerance • Weight loss • Nervousness • Tremor • Insomnia • Breathlessness • Increased bowel movements • You don’t need to list all of these signs and symptoms (there are others too) but the ones shown here should make sense if you understand how thyroid hormones work to increase basal metabolic rate, etc Calcium Regulation ECF calcium concentration tightly regulated • Normal adult range is approx. 2.2 to 2.6 mmol/L • Bone acts as a ‘reservoir’ for calcium • Calcium absorbed from intestines, enters blood and can be deposited in bone tissue by the action of osteoblasts • Calcium into blood if needed via the action of osteoclasts • The kidneys can adjust the amount of calcium lost in the urine, or reabsorb more calcium from urine if required • Most (99%) of the calcium stored in bones is in the form of hydroxyapatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 Ca++ Short term calcium exchange between bone and ECF • Some calcium in bone (<1%) is stored in form of readily mobilizable salts such as CaHPO4 (as opposed to hydroxyapatite) • such salts in reversible equilibrium with calcium and phosphate ions in ECF CaHPO4 Ca2+ + HPO4 2- • This is readily exchangeable with the ECF and acts a quick acting ‘buffer’ to minor short term fluctuations in calcium ion concentrations • The ‘exchangeable’ pool of calcium is very limited and longer lasting alterations in calcium levels require an endocrine response…. ECFBone hydroxyapatite Parathyroid Glands • Partially embedded in the posterior surface of the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland. • Usually 4, (2 superior and 2 inferior) although may be more – up to 8 in some people • approx. pea shaped and sized • Secrete parathyroid hormone (protein hormone) in response to LOW ECF calcium concentration Parathyroid gland Histology Two types of cells: 1. Chief cells or principal cells which produce parathyroid hormone (PTH) 2. Oxyphil cells - Not normally present before puberty may be modified or depleted chief cells as numbers increase with age - help with identification of parathyroid tissue • Trousseau’s sign. • Compression of the forearm produces spasm in the hand and wrist. The thumb is adducted, the fingers bunched and the wrist flexed. • Chvostek’s sign. • Tapping the face over the facial nerve in front of the tragus of the ear causes spasm of facial muscles, typically a twitch of the nose or lips.

Can lead to muscle spasms , tetany and seizures if not treated You don’t need to Remember these names • Osteoclasts don’t themselves have membrane receptors for PTH • PTH binds to receptors on osteoblasts • Osteoblasts release growth factor RANKL • Stimulates proliferation, development and activity of osteoclasts • Breakdown of bone and release of calcium into blood • PTH also act on the kidney to increase reabsorption of calcium AND stimulate the formation of calcitriol (aka ‘active Vitamin D’) ….

Weakened, bowed lower limb bones and abnormal epiphyseal plates in a child with Ricketts In adults, lack of Vit D and/or calcium can result in abnormal mineralization of mature bone = osteomalacia Bones are weaker and prone to atypical fractures https://www.radiologymasterclass.co.uk","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
