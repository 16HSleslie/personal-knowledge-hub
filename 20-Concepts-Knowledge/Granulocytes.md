**Neutrophils**:
- Most abundant types of white blood cells
- Highly phagocytic - "eat and kill" pathogens; numbers increase during infection 
- They circulate in blood and move to tissue during infection

**Mast Cells**:
- Distributed in mucosal tissue, not found blood
- They release granules containing chemicals that attract other white blood cells to areas of tissue damage (inflammatory initiation)
