MHC is proteins on cell surface that present antigen fragments to T cells.
Types of MHC:
- **MHC-I** - Presents endogenous (intracellular) antigens; found on all nucleated cells.
- **MHC-II** - Presents exogenous (extracellular) antigens; found only on professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) like dendritic cells.

### Explanation
**Antigen presentation**:
- MHC molecules display processed antigen fragments on cell surface
- T cell receptors recognise (TCRs) specific antigen-MHC complexes, leading to T cell activation.

**Functional difference**:
- **MHC-I**: Alerts cytotoxic T cells to infected or abnormal cells.
- **MHC-II**: Alerts helper T cells to external threats detected by APCs
