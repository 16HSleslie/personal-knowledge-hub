Production
**Hematopoiesis** is the process of forming new blood cells in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells.
Blood cell lineage divides into:
**Myeloid lineage** - Gives rise to red blood cells, granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and platelets
**Lymphoid lineage** - gives to B and T lymphocytes (adaptive immune system)
