Escher Moebius Strip II CHEM202 Cyclisation Reactions Part 2 3-Membered Rings in Natural Products Despite the ring strain, compounds containing 3-membered rings are quite common in nature CH3 CH3 O H H CH3 disparlure gypsy moth sex pheremone O O CH3H3C H3COOC O H3C pyrethrin II natural insecticide Lecture Problem Predict the structure of the major product of the following: Br OH HO base ? Enolate Alkylation • H atoms adjacent to C=O groupings are weakly acidic - can be removed by bases • The resulting enolate species are good nucleophiles • Reaction with alkyl halides in SN reactions forms C-C bonds • An example…… O HB O enolate+ BH O Carbanion Cyclizations - 1 • Internal SN reactions can be used to create rings of C atoms • Halide nucleophiles are unable to cleave a C-C bond – i.e. the reactions are not reversible • Data similar to those for formation of cyclic ethers (Lecture 2): n = Ring size krel 1 3 >600000 2 4 1 3 5 6200 4 6 370 Carbanion Cyclizations - 2 • Ring strain preference 6 > 5 > 3 > 4 (observed 3 > 5 > 6 >4) • Again, probability factors mean that smaller rings form faster than expected on the basis of ring strain • Difference in ΔHf (ΔHf (ring) - ΔHf (acyclic)) calculated by molecular mechanics: Ring Size ΔΔHf / kJ mol-1 3 297.6 4 353.4 5 255.7 6 234.8 200.0 220.0 240.0 260.0 280.0 300.0 320.0 340.0 360.0 380.0 3 4 5 6 Ring sizeΔΔH (kJ/mol) Neighbouring Group Participation 3-membered rings: • Form very rapidly • If formed non-reversibly they remain intact • Do they form in reversible reactions? – Yes, but they re-open rapidly to relieve ring strain – Formation and re-opening of 3-membered rings can cause some unexpected effects Rate Enhancement • Consider 2 similar SN reactions at 100 oC: CH3(CH2)4CH2Cl + H2O CH3(CH2)4CH2OH + HCl krel = 1CH3CH2SCH2CH2Cl + H2O CH3CH2SCH2CH2OH + HCl krel = 3200 • The 1st is a simple SN process – Cl– is displaced by H2O • The 2nd is very much faster - a different mechanism? – S atom is involved in internal displacement  3-membered ring – This process is assisted by favourable probability factors – The strained 3-membered ring intermediate is highly susceptible to nucleophilic opening – The most abundant nucleophile is H2O Distinguishing Between the Two Mechanisms Use CH3-CH2-S-CH2-CD2-Cl – how? Analysis of the results by 1H NMR • Recall that ROH NMR signal disappears when sample is treated with D2O D = 2H https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu48zS6ndtI Double Inversion • A substitution reaction with overall retention of stereochemistry: • SN2 reaction would give the (S)-isomer (inversion) • SN1 reaction would give both the (R) and (S)-products (attack from either face of the planar carbocation) • Explanation - 2 inversions involved - leads to overall retention • 1st step - rapid formation of a 3-membered ring inverts at the chiral carbon – 2nd step – the nucleophile opens the strained ring the product has same bond arrangement as the original reactant (R)-CH3-CHBr-COOH NaOH H2O (R)-CH3-CHOH-COOH An Unusual Reaction for an Ester The intermediate is an ester which would normally react by OH– attack at the C=O (CHEM 191): O OH3C H OH H3C O OH O H This would give the (S)-isomer. Why does this not happen? • The first step does not relieve the ring strain. • The intermediate has bad eclipsing interactions: O H3C H O OH O OH3C H OHslow O O H3C H OH Favorskii Rearrangement Suggest a mechanism for the following reaction: O Br COOEt Et = C2H5 OEt","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
