Adaptive immunity is a specialised immune response that develops in vertebrates, providing specific defence against pathogens and immunological memory.

### Explanation
- Adaptive immunity is distinct from innate immunity. It is characterised by specificity (targeting particular antigens) and memory (Faster, stronger response upon re-exposure)
- Adaptive immunity involves lymphocytes (T and B cells) and depends on antigen presentation
