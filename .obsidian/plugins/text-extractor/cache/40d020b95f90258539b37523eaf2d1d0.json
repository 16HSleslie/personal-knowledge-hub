An important aspect in considering the synthesis of organic compounds is to be able to use methods for creating the carbon skeleton by forming carbon–carbon bonds. This type of bond formation, in particular using carbonyl-containing reactants, is the central focus of this CHEM 202 module. CHEM202 (2025) Constructing Carbon Frameworks – Lucas 1.2 How can you create a C–C? Combine reactive species: Charged (polar) Uncharged (e.g. radicals, concerted reactions) This module will focus on the first (i.e. charged) approach to C–C bond formation C C+ C C C C+ C C CHEM202 (2025) Constructing Carbon Frameworks – Lucas 1.3 Electron Rich Carbon Can be an ionic species where the carbon system contains a full negative charge (i.e. carbanion), or a carbon in a polar covalent bonding array (i.e. d –): Carbanions are: § quite reactive, prepared and reacted without delay § usually associated with very electropositive metal cations (Na+, K+) to achieve electroneutrality § can be stabilised by attaching electron-withdrawing groups which delocalise the charge C M+ C M δ− δ+ carbanion polar covalent CHEM202 (2025) Constructing Carbon Frameworks – Lucas 1.3 Electron Rich Carbon Electron rich carbons which do not have stabilising substitution, are often associated with metals which are less electropositive § are able to reduce the negative charge on carbon by partial covalent bond formation (Li, Mg, Hg, Zn, B): carbon (C) 2.5 sodium (Na) 0.9 mercury (Hg) 1.5 zinc (Zn) 1.7 C Na+ C Zn δ− δ+ CHEM202 (2025) Constructing Carbon Frameworks – Lucas 1.3 Electron Rich Carbon – Other Organometallics C Li δ− δ+ C Al δ− δ+ C Zn δ− δ+ C Cu δ− δ+ C Mg δ− δ+ C Hg δ− δ+ C Sn δ− δ+ C Pd δ− δ+ CHEM202 (2025) Constructing Carbon Frameworks – Lucas 1.3 Preparation of Electron Rich Carbons How do you prepare electron rich carbon?

Ø despite these complications, organometallics of this type are very useful for organic synthesis and for the purposes of simply understanding reactions, can be usefully considered as RM.

NMR chemical shifts reflect the high electron density on the R moiety: RLi compounds are usually more reactive than RMgX, but for many reactions they are comparable.
