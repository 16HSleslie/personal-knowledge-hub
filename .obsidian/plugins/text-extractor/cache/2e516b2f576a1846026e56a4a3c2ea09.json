Gait analysis: normal and pathological function (2nded) Slack Inc.Bipedal standing•Unique to humans•Feet form base of support, but insufficient size to be only balance option•Special anatomical features at joints to assist balance•Standing achieved with very little muscular support –mostly at ankle joint11Image source: Perry & Burnfield(2010). Gait analysis: normal and pathological function (2nded) Slack Inc.Posterior to hipAnterior to kneeAnterior to ankleLine of gravityTrue or False?•The line of gravity falls posterior to the knee•Dorsiflexors stabilize the ankle during upright standing•The agonists of hip flexion are iliopsoas and rectus femoris12Bipedal walking•Learned movement strategy•Gait is characteristic•Basic pattern = gait cycle•Complex series of movements•STANCE•SWING•Transition phases between these •Heel strike•Toe off13The gait cycle•Is complex and dynamic•Involves lots of movements and muscles•we will focus on flexion and extension, and only using muscles we learnt yesterday•Many phases = how many depends on where you look•We will focus on 6 key parts•Images show ‘snapshots’ in time.•Cycle is continuous and in motion•Joints may be in one position, but moving into another-the muscle action will reflect where we want the joint to end up•Don’t overthink this. Cannot be easily rote learnt. Need to understand muscle roles, then practice, while thinking about what you’re doing1415___________________|______________________________SWING PHASE STANCE PHASERIGHTLEGLEFTLEGswing phaseswing phasestance phasestance phasestance phasedoublestancephasedoublestancephaseswing phase1516Early stance + heel strikeMid stanceLate stance + toe offEarly swingMid swingLate swingGait is dynamicFor each phase consider:•Position joint starts in•Position joint needs to be for next phase•What muscle & type of contraction will bring the joint to the next phase17Early stance (includes heel strike)18HEEL -STRIKEImage source: Perry & Burnfield (2010).

What muscles must contract? What type of contraction? •Practice walking and thinking about each joint26Practice essay27i) Compare the structure of the ankle to the hip joint, noting differences in bones, muscles and movement. (3) The ankle is an important region of the lower limb. Write an essay on the structure and function of the knee, including the following components:ii) Outline the changes in position of the ankle joint throughout both swing and stance phases of the gait cycle, including the roles of muscles. (3)iii) Describe how severe damage to the tibialis anterior would impact the normal gait cycle.
