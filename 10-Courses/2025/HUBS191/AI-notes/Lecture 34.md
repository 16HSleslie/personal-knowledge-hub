## 1. Introduction to Adaptive Immunity

**Key Concepts:**

- **Adaptive Immunity:** A specialized immune response that develops in vertebrates, providing specific defence against pathogens and immunological memory.

**Explanation:**

- Adaptive immunity is distinct from innate immunity. It is characterized by specificity (targeting particular antigens) and memory (faster, stronger response upon re-exposure).
- Adaptive immunity involves lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) and depends on antigen presentation.

## 2. Evolution of Adaptive Immunity

**Key Concepts:**

- **Evolution:** Adaptive immunity evolved in vertebrates around 500 million years ago.

**Explanation:**

- Invertebrates (e.g., insects, jellyfish) possess only innate immunity.
- Vertebrates have both innate and adaptive immune systems.
- Jawless fish (Agnathans: lamprey, hagfish) have a unique form of adaptive immunity, different from that of higher vertebrates.

**Key Visuals or Data:**

- _Evolutionary tree diagram_: Shows adaptive immunity first appearing in jawless fishes (~450 million years ago), with classical adaptive immunity in higher vertebrates (tetrapods, mammals).
    - _Summary_: Demonstrates the evolutionary emergence and diversification of adaptive immunity in vertebrates.

## 3. White Blood Cells and Immune Response

**Key Concepts:**

- **Leukocytes (White Blood Cells):** Main cellular components of the immune system, though they are a minor constituent of blood.

**Explanation:**

- Leukocytes include lymphocytes (T cells, B cells), dendritic cells, macrophages, and others.
- They are crucial for both innate and adaptive immune responses.

**Key Visuals or Data:**

- _Test tube blood fractionation diagram_: Shows plasma, a thin leukocyte layer, and red blood cells.
    - _Summary_: Illustrates the small proportion of leukocytes in blood but highlights their essential immune function.

## 4. Antigen: Definition and Types

**Key Concepts:**

- **Antigen:** Anything that can be recognized by the immune system.
    - **Foreign antigen:** Originates from outside the body (e.g., pathogens, transplants, chemicals).
    - **Self (auto) antigen:** Normally tolerated by the immune system; recognition can lead to autoimmune diseases.

**Explanation:**

- The immune system distinguishes between self and non-self antigens.
- Loss of tolerance to self-antigens can cause autoimmune disorders (e.g., Rheumatoid Arthritis, Type I Diabetes).

**Quiz Reference:**

- The best definition of antigen: **Anything that can be recognised by an immune system.**

## 5. Antigen Sampling and Presentation

**Key Concepts:**

- **Dendritic Cells (DC):** The most potent antigen-presenting cells, present in major organs.

**Explanation:**

- DCs phagocytose (engulf) antigens, process them into peptides, and migrate to lymph nodes.
- In lymph nodes, DCs present antigenic peptides to T cells via MHC molecules, initiating adaptive immune responses.

**Key Visuals or Data:**

- _Schematic of infection and immune activation_: Shows dendritic cells capturing antigens in tissue, migrating to lymph nodes, and activating T and B cells.
    
    - _Summary_: Highlights the central role of DCs in linking innate detection to adaptive activation.
- _Phagocytosis micrograph_: Shows a phagocytic cell engulfing bacteria.
    
    - _Summary_: Demonstrates the physical process of antigen uptake by immune cells.

**Purpose of Antigen Uptake:**

- **Innate response:** Clearance of pathogens.
- **Adaptive response:** Presentation to T cells for specific immune activation.

## 6. Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)

### Overview

**Key Concepts:**

- **MHC molecules:** Proteins on cell surfaces that display peptide antigens to T cells.
    - **MHC-I:** Presents endogenous (intracellular) antigens; expressed on all nucleated cells.
    - **MHC-II:** Presents exogenous (extracellular) antigens; expressed only on antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

**Explanation:**

- The MHC system is essential for immune surveillance and activation of T cells.
- Different antigen sources are processed and presented by distinct MHC pathways.

#### MHC-I Pathway (Endogenous Antigen)

**Key Concepts:**

- **Endogenous antigen:** Originates from within the cell (e.g., viral proteins).
- **Proteasome:** Degrades cytoplasmic proteins into peptides.

**Steps:**

1. Intracellular proteins (e.g., viral) are degraded by the proteasome into peptides.
2. Peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
3. Peptides are loaded onto MHC-I molecules in the ER.
4. MHC-I/peptide complexes are transported to the cell surface for recognition by **CD8+ T cells** (cytotoxic T lymphocytes).

**Key Visuals or Data:**

- _Diagram of MHC-I processing_: Shows viral proteins degraded in cytosol, peptides loaded in ER, and presentation to CD8 T cells.
    - _Summary_: Explains how infected cells alert cytotoxic T cells to intracellular pathogens.

#### MHC-II Pathway (Exogenous Antigen)

**Key Concepts:**

- **Exogenous antigen:** Originates from outside the cell (e.g., bacteria, extracellular viruses).
- **Phagolysosome:** Acidic compartment where proteins are degraded.

**Steps:**

1. APCs (e.g., dendritic cells) phagocytose extracellular antigens.
2. Antigenic proteins are degraded in the acidic phagolysosome.
3. Peptides are loaded onto MHC-II molecules within the phagolysosome.
4. MHC-II/peptide complexes are transported to the cell surface for recognition by **CD4+ T cells** (helper T cells).

**Key Visuals or Data:**

- _Diagram of MHC-II processing_: Shows phagocytosis, degradation in phagolysosome, and presentation to CD4 T cells.
    - _Summary_: Illustrates how APCs present external threats to helper T cells.

## 7. Activation of Adaptive Immune Cells

**Key Concepts:**

- **Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs):** Cells (mainly dendritic cells) that process and present antigens to T cells.
- **CD4+ T cells (Helper T cells):** Recognize antigens on MHC-II; help activate B cells and other immune cells.
- **CD8+ T cells (Cytotoxic T cells):** Recognize antigens on MHC-I; kill infected or cancerous cells.

**Explanation:**

- Upon infection, dendritic cells present antigens to T cells in lymph nodes.
- **CD4+ T cells** provide "help" signals (cytokines) to B cells, promoting their differentiation into plasma cells that secrete antibodies.
- **CD8+ T cells** are activated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which induce apoptosis in infected cells via perforin and granzyme.

**Key Visuals or Data:**

- _Adaptive immunity flow diagram_: Shows APCs activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, leading to antibody production and cytotoxic killing.
    - _Summary_: Integrates the roles of different immune cells and the flow of adaptive responses.

## 8. Summary and Exam Tips

- **Adaptive immunity is a vertebrate innovation, evolving ~500 million years ago.**
- **Antigen:** Anything recognized by the immune system (self or foreign).
- **Dendritic cells** are key antigen-presenting cells, linking innate and adaptive immunity.
- **MHC-I** is expressed on all nucleated cells and presents endogenous antigens to **CD8+ T cells**.
- **MHC-II** is expressed only on antigen-presenting cells and presents exogenous antigens to **CD4+ T cells**.
- **Proteasome** degrades cytoplasmic proteins for MHC-I presentation; **phagolysosome** degrades extracellular proteins for MHC-II presentation.
- **Activation sequence:** Pathogen → Antigen uptake by DC → Migration to lymph node → Antigen presentation → T cell activation → B cell help or cytotoxic response.

**Pitfalls:**

- Confusing MHC-I and MHC-II pathways or their expression patterns.
- Forgetting that only antigen-presenting cells express MHC-II.
- Assuming all antigens are foreign; self-antigens are important in autoimmunity.

**Tips:**

- Use flow diagrams to visualize antigen processing and presentation pathways.
- Remember the link between antigen source (endogenous/exogenous) and MHC pathway.
- Relate the function of T cell subsets (CD4+ and CD8+) to their MHC restriction and immune roles.
