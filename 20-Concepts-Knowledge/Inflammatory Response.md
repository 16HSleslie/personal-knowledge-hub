Inflammation is a localised tissue response to an injury or infection, recruiting in immune cells to site

**Explanation**:
- Triggered by tissue damage or infection
- Tissue-resident cells (e.g. mast cells, macrophages) release chemical signals (cytokines, chemokines)
- These signals:
- Attract immune cells
- Cause vasodilation
- Increase capillary permeability
 **Neutrophils**:
- Enter the blood from bone marrow
- Adhere to capillary walls near injury
- Squeeze through vessel walls (extravasation) following chemical gradients to the site
