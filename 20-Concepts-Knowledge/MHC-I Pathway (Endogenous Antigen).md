MHC-I presents **endogenous antigens** that originated within the cell (e.g. viral protein), it is expressed on all nucleated cells.
The **proteasome** degrades cytoplasmic proteins into peptides

### Steps
1. Intracellular proteins are degraded by the proteasome into peptides
2. Peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
3. Peptides are loaded onto MCH-I molecules in the ER.
4. MHC-I/peptide complexes are transported to the cell surface for recognition by CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes)
