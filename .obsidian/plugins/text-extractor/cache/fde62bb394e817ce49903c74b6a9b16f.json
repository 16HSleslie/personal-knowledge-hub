HUBS191 Lecture 36 B cells and antibody Prof. Alex McLellan, Dept. Microbiology & Immunology Objectives • Know that B cells produce antibody • Understand the role of antibody in the immune system (neutralization, opsonization and complement activation) • Know the roles of the different classes of antibody (IgG, IgM, IgA & IgE) • Appreciate the difference between primary and secondary immune responses • Pre-reading: Marieb; p806-811 1 CD8+ TCR MHC-I peptide APC CTL apoptosis Perforin / granzyme Vaccines / pathogens Virus- infected cell B cell Antibody production TCR MHC-II CD4peptide CD4+‘Help’ ‘Help’ CD8 Plasma cell Native antigen MHC-I / Peptide TCR 2 B cells • Are lymphocytes that develop in the bone marrow • Express unique antigen receptors (BCR or secreted antibody) • Plasma cells are activated B cells that secrete antibody • Memory B cells provide ‘memory’ 3 Marieb Figure 21.8 Lymphocyte development, maturation, and activation. © 2016 Pearson Education, Ltd. 1 2 Adaptive defenses Humoral immunity Cellular immunity Bone marrow Lymphocyte precursors Thymus Bone marrow Lymph node Antigen Primary lymphoid organs (red bone marrow and thymus) Secondary lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen, etc.) Origin Maturation • Both B and T lymphocyte precursors originate in red bone marrow. • Lymphocyte precursors destined to become T cells migrate (in blood) to the thymus and mature there. • B cells mature in the bone marrow. • During maturation lymphocytes develop immunocompetence and self-tolerance. Slide 3 4 Fig. 43-9a Antigen- binding site Antigen- binding site Disulfide bridge Variable regions Constant regions Transmembrane region Plasma membrane Light chain Heavy chains Cytoplasm of B cell (a) B cell receptor B cell C C 5 B cell receptor (BCR) • The surface of each B cell is covered with ~100,000 BCR (mainly IgM / IgD antibodies). • The BCR binds antigen and activates the B cell. • BCR is membrane anchored via a transmembrane domain (TM). Secreted antibodies lack a TM 6 Three functions of antibody 1. Neutralisation 2. Opsonisation (‘to make tasty to phagocytes’) 3. Complement activation 7 Fig. 43-21a Viral neutralization Virus 8 Fig. 43-21b Opsonisation Bacterium Macrophage 9 Fig. 43-21c Activation of complement system and pore formation Complement proteins Formation of membrane attack complex Flow of water and ions Pore Foreign cell 10 Antibodies bind native antigens. Several different antibodies may target a single type of microbe. The term native antigen means that the antigen does not have to be processed to peptide (or in context of MHC). Antibodies can recognise just about any structure! Antibodies binding to defined regions (antibody binding sites) on a larger structure Epitopes Antibody binding site = “epitope” 11 Fig. 43-20b Distribution Function Class of Immuno- globulin (Antibody) IgG (monomer) Most abundant Ig class in blood. Opsonises / Neutralises Only Ig class that crosses placenta: provides ‘passive Immunity’ Targets virus / bacteria 12 Fig. 43-20c Distribution Function Class of Immuno- globulin (Antibody) IgA (dimer) J chain Secretory component Present in secretions such as tears, saliva, mucus, and breast milk Monomeric form in blood Defence of mucous membranes, esp. gut Present in breast milk. Confers ‘passive immunity’ on nursing infant Targets virus / bacteria 13 Fig. 43-22 ‘Passive Immunity’ IgA in milk transferred to infant 14 Fig. 43-20a Distribution Class of Immuno- globulin (Antibody) IgM (pentamer) J chain First Ig class produced after initial exposure to antigen. Expressed on naïve B cells Very effective in activating Complement Function Targets extracellular bacteria Acts as antigen receptor (BCR) 15 Fig. 43-20d Distribution Function Class of Immuno- globulin (Antibody) IgE (monomer) Present in blood at low concen- trations Immunity to multicellular parasites Allergic reactions (e.g. to pollen or penicillin) IgE activates mast cells for parasite immunity and the allergic response 16 Fig. 43-20e Distribution Function Class of Immuno- globulin (Antibody) IgD (monomer) Expressed on naïve B cells Together with IgM, acts as antigen receptor (BCR) Specific function unknown 17 Memory responses • Stimulation of B cells by antigen + T cell leads to formation of plasma cells. • In addition, a small number of stimulated B cells form a pool of memory cells. 18 Memory cells • Memory cells persist for years in blood and lymphatic tissue. • Express antibody as BCR, but do not secrete antibody. • Respond rapidly to antigen encounter and become plasma cells. 19 Primary immune responses • Takes around 7-14 days before sufficient antibody is produced to eliminate pathogen. • Relatively low amount of antibody produced – mainly IgM. 20 Secondary immune responses • Basis of the success of vaccination. • Relies on memory B cells. • Fast: 2-3 days, sufficient antibody is produced to eliminate pathogen - mainly IgG, with additional class switching to IgA and IgE (low levels) 21Figure 21.12 Primary and secondary humoral responses. Primary immune response to antigen A occurs after a delay. Secondary immune response to antigen A is faster and larger; primary immune response to antigen B is similar to that for antigen A.

Six months later the same individual is exposed to both antigens A and B. After the second exposure, the individual would: A) make a primary response to A and a secondary response to B B) make a secondary response to both A and B C) make a secondary response to A and a primary response to B 36 Memory B cells: A) Express the BCR, but do not secrete antibody B) Do not express the BCR, but secrete antibody C) Help other B cells secrete antibody D) Are also known as ‘plasma cells’ 37 The following is true of plasma cells A) can become memory B cells B) are derived from T cells C) possess a BCR D) secrete antibody 38 Only B cells specific for tetanus toxin (TT) would undergo clonal expansion during an immune response to TT because: A) They have an antigen-specific TCR B) They can sense what is dangerous to the body. C) They bind native TT and present a peptide from TT to Ag-specific CD4+ T cells. D) They respond to TT by rearranging their B cell receptor DNA 39 HUBS191 Copyright Warning Notice This coursepack may be used only for the University’s educational purposes.
