Some transport proteins in membranes are able to move molecules against their concentration gradient. This requires the use of energy which is typically supplied by ATP (adenosine triphosphate). 
This form of transport allows a cell to have an internal concentration of a substance that is different from its surroundings. So the concentration of a substance may  be higher inside than in the surroundings.
