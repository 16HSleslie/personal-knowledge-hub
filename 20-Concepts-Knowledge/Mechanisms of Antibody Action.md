Antibodies protect against pathogens through three main mechanisms:
- **Neutralisation**
- **Opsonisation**
- **Complement activation**


### Neutralisation
- **Definition**: Antibodies bind to the pathogens and block their ability to infect or damage host cells
- **Example**: Antibodies coating a virus prevents it from binding to host cell receptors

### Opsonisation
- **Definition**: Antibodies coat pathogens, making them more attractive to phagocytes like macrophages
- Explanation: Phagocytes have receptors for Fc region of antibodies, facilitating uptake and destruction of pathogens

### Complement Activation
- **Definition**: Antibody binding triggers the complement cascade, leading to the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and lysis of the pathogen
- **Example**: Complement proteins assemble on the antibody-coated pathogen, forming pores that disrupt cell membrane
