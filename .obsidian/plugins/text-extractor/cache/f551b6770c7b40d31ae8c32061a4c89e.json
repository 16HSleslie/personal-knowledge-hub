Table of NMR active isotopes) due to; • low natural abundance, 1.11 % • inherent low sensitivity ieH/C= 4 •13C nuclei can have long relaxation times 138 13C NMR relaxation 139 What do the long relaxation time carbons have in common? Attachment to protons allows more rapid relaxation (nOe) Quaternary carbons usually have the longest relaxation times. Integration is rarely useful on a 13C spectrum Carbon peaks are usually measured as narrow singlets so their intensity is a proxy for their integral Peaks with long relaxation times will not receive a full 90 degree pulse upon repeated excitation, unless the delay between experiments is extended. The integral/intensity thus varies considerably and cannot normally be used in the same way as in 1H NMR. 140 Features of 13C NMR Spectra Differences to 1H spectra • the chemical shift range is much wider, 0-230 ppm • no homo-nuclear, 13C -13C, coupling is observed. This is a consequence of the low natural abundanceof 13C nuclei ie it is very unlikely to find two neighbouring 13C nuclei. • hetero-nuclear, 13C -1H, coupling is observed and yields the number of H’s attached to each C ie the carbon type: methyl, methylene, methine or quaternary carbon. • Whether a carbon is C, CH, CH2 or CH3 is often referred to as its multiplicity. • the spectrum can be obtained with hetero-nuclear decoupling ie all the 13C signals will appear as singlet, irrespective of C–H coupling. Referred to as broad band decoupling, helps with sensitivity (why?)141142 C-H coupling Works the same as proton coupling, but now we consider one bond (C-H) coupling. 1JC-Hranges between 120 – 250 Hz Varies strongly with hybridisation, e.g. sp3 = 125 Hz, sp2 = 155 Hz, sp = 250 Hz Also affected by substituents e.g. F–13C–H; 1JC-H= 150 Hz e.g. alkyl–13C–H; 1JC-H= 125 Hz Decreases with distance, 2JC-H~ -10 – 20 Hz 3JC-Hfor unsaturated systems ~5 – 15 Hz Most 13C spetra are broadband decoupled, so you won’t see these splittings! 143 Similarities to 1H spectra • The number of signals from the proton decoupled spectrum gives the number of different carbon environments. • The chemical shift gives information on the hybridisation of the carbon and the chemical environment. • The factors that influenced the chemical shift of 1H also affect the of 13C eg shielding and deshielding effects. 144 13C chemical shift range 145 13C chemical shift range similar relative positions to 1H 146 (1H chemical shift) Inductive Effects 147 Mesomeric effects 148 Example 13C spectrum (H-decoupled) 149 Bonus question: • Why does CDCl3appear as a triplet in H-decoupled 13C spectra? •Hint: Deuterium is not affected by broadband H decoupling 150 Broad band decoupled 13C {1H} 151 Which is which? 152 How has the multiplicity of the peaks in these spectra been determined?? Single frequency off resonance decoupling (SFORD) 153 DEPT(Distortionless Enhancement by Polarisation Transfer) and APT(Attached Proton Test) experiments • Either of these two experiments can be used to detect protonated carbons and determine carbon-type ie methyl, methylene or methine (carbon multiplicity) • Energy (polarisation) is transferred from one nuclei (1H) to the other (13C) • The degree of transfer is dependent on experimental constraints and the carbon-type and impacts significantly on the relative intensity (and phase) of the carbon signals 154 DEPT carbon-13 NMR spectrum of citronellal. 155 CH and CH3positive while CH2and quaternary C are negative APT provides the same information based on phase (positive or negative) 156CH and CH3positive while CH2and quaternary C are negative CH and CH3(odds) positive CH2and quaternary C (evens) negative HETCOR (Heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy) • Spectrum is a 2D plot of 1H frequency vs 13C frequency (cf COSY) • HSQC correlates proton signals to the carbon to which the protons are attached (specific to one-bond C-H coupling) • By checking cross peaks for every carbon signal, we can assign carbon multiplicity HSQC spectrum of 2-methyl-3- pentanone. Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (Single = 1 bond) 157 The APT or DEPT would help deconvolute 13C spectrum But HSQC also gives us the (mutual) information about the 1H signals Blue = CH2, Red = CH/CH3, quaternary signals have no cross peak 158 HSQC is powerful End of Module! 159 Use the websites NMR tutorial next week Practical NMR experience will also come from labs","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
