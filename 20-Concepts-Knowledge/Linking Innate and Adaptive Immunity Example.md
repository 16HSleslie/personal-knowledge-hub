### Explanation
1. Physical barrier (skin) is breached
2. Pathogen enter the body
3. Chemical mediators cause vasodilation; phagocytes enter tissue to destroy pathogens
4. Complement system is activated
5. Dendritic cells recognise pathogens, becoming activated, and migrate to lymph nodes
6. Dendritic cells present to T cells MHC
7. T cells and complement help activate B cells.
8. B cells produce antibodies
9. Complement, phagocytosis, and antibodies work together to clear pathogen
