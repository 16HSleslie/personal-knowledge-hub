Escher Curl-up CHEM202 Cyclisation Reactions Part 1 Recap of yesterday… • Newman projections • Eclipsed through to staggered conformations • Ring strain: Torsional, bond angle and van der Waals interactions Favoured Ring Size Varies The 6-membered ring is not always the most favoured Some influential factors: • Atoms other than C may have different preferred bond angles • Divalent ring atoms: – have no bonds to become involved in eclipsing – have no attached groupings – less van der Waals interaction – planar conformations may be feasible • Interactions between charged or partially charged centres Molecular modelling is again very helpful Ring Formation • Rings of various sizes and compositions are known • Ring formation is a very important part of synthetic chemistry O O H3C OH H3C HO H3C O CH3 CH3 CH3 OH O O O HO N(CH3)2 CH3 O CH3 OH CH3 OCH3 erythromycin a natural antibiotic • Look at formation of rings from acyclic compounds: • Key factor – is the ring formation reversible? Recap on Substitution Reactions • Types? • Mechanistic differences? • Kinetics • Substrate scope Irreversible Ring Formation • Irreversible ring formations are controlled by the rate of product formation (kinetic control) • The lower the activation energy, the faster the product will form E Slower Faster Reactant Product Reversible Ring Formation • These reactions are under thermodynamic control • Equilibrium composition reflects the stability of the ring system • Cyclized products may only be isolated if the ring has little strain Hemiacetal Formation • Results when an alcohol and an aldehyde are treated with acid (CHEM 191) C O R H H + C O R H H C O R H H C O R1 H H R 2 OH C O R 1 H H R 2 O H C O R 1 H H R 2 O + H + Cyclic Hemiacetal Formation • If both components are part of the same molecule  a ring • Equilibrium only favours cyclized product if the ring is unstrained A product with a 5-membered ring may be isolated: • Hemiacetal rings are very important in carbohydrate chemistry – e.g. monosaccharides (CHEM 191): – The only significant cyclic species have 5 or 6-membered rings – Levels of 3, 4 or 7-membered ring species are negligible1 2 3 4 OH O H 2 3 4 O1HO but one with a 3-membered ring cannot: 1 2 OH O H 1 2 O HO D-Ribose • How many cyclic hemiacetals would you expect to form? D-Ribose in Water at 25oC As expected from ΔHr values calculated (ΔHf (ring) - ΔHf (acyclic), molecular mechanics) for cyclization to the various ring forms: Ribose exists only in furanose and pyranose forms Ring ΔHr (kJ/mol) size α β 3 114.1 98.6 4 302.1 303.1 5 6.1 -8.4 6 -4.1 -1.3 Note: • Formation of 3 and 4-membered rings is highly endothermic. • For the 5β, 6α and 6β isomers, ring formation is predicted to be exothermic. • Calculations are for the gas phase. There will be some differences in water solution. -50.0 0.0 50.0 100.0 150.0 200.0 250.0 300.0 350.0 3 4 5 6 Ring sizeΔHr (kJ/mol) alpha isomer beta isomer Cyclic Ethers • Alkoxide + alkyl halide  ether (SN2 reaction – CHEM 191) • If both functions are part of the same molecule  cyclic ether • Not reversible - halide ion (nucleophile) cannot displace alkoxide ion (poor leaving group) • Rate of reaction strongly dependent on ring size. Observations: – 3  5 > 6 > 4  7 > 8 – 8-membered ring: • High degree of polymerisation • Rate of internal reaction is very slow • Intermolecular reaction becomes competitive – 9 to 11-membered rings do not form Explanation - 1 • The difference in ΔHf (ΔHf (ring) - ΔHf (acyclic)) calculated by molecular mechanics shows the strain present in each of the ring forms: • i.e. ring strain preference 6 > 5 > 7 > 8 > 3 > 4 (c.f. observed 3  5 > 6 > 4  7 > 8) Ring Size ΔΔHf / kJ mol-1 3 82.8 4 248.5 5 33.9 6 17.2 7 41.4 8 66.6 0.0 50.0 100.0 150.0 200.0 250.0 300.0 3 4 5 6 7 8 Ring sizeΔΔH (kJ/mol) Explanation - 2 • Must be some additional factor: – Relates to the probability of the reacting centres coming together to attain the necessary transition state – If no. of intervening bonds is large, this will be low • With the 3-membered ring, probability is very high – the preferred conformation is that required for cyclization: H O H H Br H Bulky groups anti – preferred conformation Nucleophile ready for backside attack • As the ring size increases, the probability factor becomes less favourable • Results overall represent a combination of ring strain and probability factors 3-Membered Rings in Natural Products Despite the ring strain, compounds containing 3-membered rings are quite common in nature CH3 CH3 O H H CH3 disparlure gypsy moth sex pheremone O O CH3H3C H3COOC O H3C pyrethrin II natural insecticide Lecture Problem Predict the major product of the following reaction: Br OH HO base ?","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
