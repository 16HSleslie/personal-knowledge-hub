*T cells* are a type of **lymphocyte** central to adaptive immunity. They are responsible for recognising infected or abnormal cells and coordinating immune response

### Explanation 
- T cells *originate* in the **bone marrow** and mature in the **thymus**
- They express a unique T cell receptor (TCR) that recognises specific antigens presented by other cells
- Two main types
	- CD4 T cells (helper T cells)
	- CD8 T cells (cytotoxic T cells)
